Thus, trust in a fallible and corruptible human intermediary migrates toward complex algorithms and mathematical equations that ensure users wishing to exchange value can transact with each other securely.

The security is even greater since information is no longer stored on the servers of a single company or institution (which makes the system fragile in the event of a failure of the server owner) but is distributed and decentralized across a multitude of servers while maintaining user privacy through data encryption. This is referred to as algorithmic governance.

Algorithmic governance is based on a process of automating the production of knowledge in which computer code serves as law: **“code is law”** (Lessig, 2020). This raises the question of the intent behind the code, which we will revisit, and the goals pursued by algorithms.

Talking about THE blockchain technology, as is often heard in the media, therefore makes little sense since there are as many blockchains as there are possible programming codes. Blockchains can thus enable a very wide range of uses depending on the infrastructure of the protocols for which they are designed, resulting in appropriate models of algorithmic governance for organizing a system of human collaboration.

To summarize, a blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, also referred to by the PACTE law (Action Plan for Growth and Transformation of Companies) as a shared electronic recording device (DEEP). This DEEP comprises three main functions: 1. that of a ledger, 2. that of exchange, 3. that of organization. Essentially, a blockchain is a computer ledger protected by cryptography (function 1), allowing for the sharing of information and the circulation of tokens representing various values or rights (function 2) according to well-defined rules (function 3). It is a software protocol that can be seen as a technological building block implementing the internet protocol by enabling the secure and immutable hosting of value through its infrastructure.

Each blockchain adapts the settings of these functions to the needs of societies in terms of financing, activity, or governance (Magnier & Barban, 2019, p. 8). A blockchain allows for the establishment of algorithmic governance through the use of smart contracts, which aim to create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

DAOs are complex systems that can be built on algorithms to: control access to certain resources, ensure the circulation of tokens, and provide ad hoc governance (specific to the intended use). They are primarily governed by smart contracts, which are functions [if...then]; if a particular action occurs, then a specific action is triggered. This allows for moving beyond the binary exchange of “contract-exchange.”

Depending on the given organization, a blockchain can take four forms:

1. Public: transparent and without any manager or operator, with completely decentralized governance, which implies consensus mechanisms that we will examine later with the Bitcoin blockchain and its proof-of-work mechanism.
2. Semi-public: the consensus process is open to all but favors certain actors.
3. Semi-private (consortium): operates with the co-opting of actors with different rights.
4. Private: with human governance and confidentiality of completed transactions.

It should be noted that private blockchains are referred to as blockchains in a misnomer, but are in fact only distributed ledger technologies (or DLT for Distributed Ledger Technology).

When decentralization is absent, one cannot speak of blockchain.

The ultimate goal of public blockchains is the advent of a world without intermediaries, with the focus on the disappearance of states, as blockchains pose themselves as instruments for transcending state sovereignty (Jacquemin et al., 2020, p. 34).

Paradoxically, users of private blockchains are wary of total decentralization. The former can be seen as similar to the individuals described in McGregor's Theory Y, while the latter are regarded as akin to those in Theory X (McGregor, 1960).

For Douglas McGregor, X organizations differ from Y organizations in that the former are based on the assumption that people are inherently lazy and avoid work, which is why it is essential to control them to ensure they work, leading to demotivation and a sense of irresponsibility that results in active disengagement, thus confirming the initial postulate. Conversely, Theory Y posits that people enjoy working and need to be autonomous and responsible, which makes any type of control unnecessary, establishing a sense of trust that leads to motivation validating Theory Y.
