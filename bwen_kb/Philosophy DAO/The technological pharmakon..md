The limitations of blockchain technologies lie in the intentions underpinning the codes.

# Using Technology for Good or Ill

Every technology is a “pharmakon,” both a bearer of the worst and the best, a remedy and a poison, depending on the user's reasoning. **“When reason is lost, all the technological powers that are in our hands, as so many 'advancements of civilization,' become weapons of destruction through which this 'civilization' reverts to the barbarism it contains — and this constitutes the major issue of the pharmacological question in the era of disruption”** (Stiegler, 2010, p. 210). The human challenge is to achieve what Paul Valéry calls the “devaluation of spirit.”

However, for reason to remain and not be lost in the meanders of mercantile individualism, one must first trade the quantophrenic values that animate the collective psyche for the **“non-dimensional values”** defined by [[Yves Schwartz]] as the values of **“the political, the ‘common good’ (health, education, culture) in a ‘world of values’ where there is no clear internal limitation between them, nor possible hierarchization”** (2009, p. 260).

For the ergologist wishing to bring a working community to **“working well together,”** a dialogue must be established among all stakeholders so that they can attune their values.

The resonance, or attunement, of values involves a dialogue that Yves Schwartz could qualify as a **“meeting of meetings,”** which is **“a combinatory that is always partially renewed, an interface that is always partially re-singularized between technical environments, technical objects, and humans at work”** (p. 225).

In this confrontation of viewpoints, two or more opinions will clash to arrive at an attunement whose outcome is unknown until the voices of the stakeholders resonate in agreement.

**“This epistemological positioning necessarily involves accepting the encounter with the unknown, the uncontrollable, or in other words, the uncertainties of life”** (Noël-Lemaitre, 2016, p. 43).

The dynamic nature of life ensures that the expression of the organic resonates with ever more liveliness. By entering into resonance with each other, individuals create an ambiance of synergistic emulation within which everyone can flourish as a singular being and restore the essence of their personal idiosyncrasy, amplified by their interactions.

**“When people know that many others are concerned about their work and want to cooperate with them, they feel free to experiment, innovate, and learn. In other words, the support of the entire system encourages individuals to take on challenges and cooperate by giving their best”** (Cooperrider & Whitney, 2016, p. 118).

# Discovering Common Agreement

Once the encounter with the unknown is no longer seen as a trial to be overcome but as an adventure to be realized through collective work, the uncontrollable nature is no longer posed in terms of problems but in terms of solutions. Although Hannah Arendt rightly analyzes that **“the aversion of reason to contingency is very strong”** (2012, p. 852), the dialogical approach to facing the complexity of life responds to this solution-oriented and systemic approach to work. The aversion of reason is largely driven by fear and ignorance; however, when peers interact, they mutually enrich one another and diminish these, resulting in greater trust in the face of what is contingent.

# Using Technology for Good

Once the common values are attuned and the collective reason found, the **“pharmakon”** of new technologies can be used for the better, serving as a remedy for the pathologies of the market.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] defines collective reason as **“the sum of ideas that spontaneously arise, as an expression of its nature, from the social group, through its formation, action, development, preservation, and its tendency towards perfection and well-being.”**

Blockchains, and the DAOs they propose, can be enabling technologies for a collective in search of meaning, facilitating communication and the attunement of individuals to achieve harmonious governance, grounded in an equal consensus tested by the collective reason of a company.

Ultimately, these tools serve as levers for collective emancipation.
