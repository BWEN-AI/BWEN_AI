### The Three Dimensions of Governance

For the epistemologist Karl Popper, the fractalization of governance operates in three worlds: World 1, which consists of material things; World 2, which is the subjective realm of values; and World 3, which encompasses the objective or intersubjective structures produced by humans, either intentionally or unintentionally. While governance can act on each world, it only becomes a reality within World 3, the realm of intersubjectivities from which it emerges (Popper, 1972).

This tripartite approach to governance aligns with the perspective of Pierre-Yves Gomez, who asserts that real work constitutes "a triple experience: a subjective experience because, regardless of its nature, work is always performed by a singular subject: someone who works; an objective experience because it leads to the production of a material object, a good or a service: work creates something; and a collective experience because one never works alone but either with others or for others: work is embedded within a social community" (Gomez, 2013, pp. 172-173).

Thus, Gomez's collective dimension resonates with Popper's World 3, where the governance models of human groups are shaped within a web of intersubjectivities. Work and governance are intrinsically linked, as the latter influences the former, and the outcomes of work activities can vary significantly depending on the governance mode adopted for a specific task within a particular environment.

However, governance also depends on work, as alternative forms of work organization that are more liberating—such as liberated, deliberate, humanistic, evolving, appreciative, or holacratic enterprises—all seek to provide a certain "happiness at work" (Renié, 2020). This is much less clear-cut in a military command chain. In practice, as humans organize themselves and develop various types of governance, they will impact the real world to a greater or lesser extent and must reorganize accordingly. In other words, our environment influences us, but we can also influence it in order to benefit from the renewed influence of a renormalized environment for positive evolution.

There is, therefore, a double movement at play: first, the production of a more effective norm (the new form of governance in World 3, resulting from collective renormalization), followed by a transformation of our physical environment and our values (the action resulting from the influence of renormalization on Worlds 1 and 2). The previously renormalized norm will serve as the antecedent norm for its successor, since "activity corresponds to a repeated attempt by a unique individual to replay, in the present configuration, norms that are both prior to the action and anonymous" (Schwartz, 2009, p. 258). This underscores the dynamic and ever-changing nature of work, management, or governance activities.

Governance, regardless of its form, is thus an evolutionary process that must be capable of reconfiguring itself according to the needs for coordination and governance generated by a changing context that also generates increasing complexity. We speak of a hyper-complexity of reality, where the particular and the general interact with each other in a holographic manner (Morin & Le Moigne, 1999), where the whole and its parts resonate and respond to each other.

However, this holographic principle, which attempts to clarify the complex dialogical relationship between the whole and its parts, seems to clash with the current fractal governance paradigm, which reproduces the authoritarian structure of the dominant political model of representative democracy—a descending vertical hierarchy—across all human and social structures.
