With the rise of mass production and the standardization of processes and products initially, followed by the flourishing of digital technology and new technologies, the relationship to objects, consumption, and property fundamentally changes.

Until the end of the first half of the 20th century, and despite the first assembly lines inspired by Fordism, the relationship to consumer goods is singular and unitary, meaning that the same good can only belong to one person and not to multiple people at once. The right to material property thus materializes as an unbreakable link between the object and the person who acquired it. There is a personal connection between the good and its owner.

The new production techniques adopted after the war, which significantly contributed to the post-war economic boom (the "Trente Glorieuses"), and the emergence of electronics in industrial processes lead to increased standardization and production increasingly taking the form of (re)production. Patents, copyrights, and all avatars of industrial property rights become widespread to theoretically protect inventors or entrepreneurs of a defined object.

It is within these various forms of property titles that value will gradually find its niche in the modern era, where profit and wealth are more the product of the authorship of a good, an idea, or a chemical formula, rather than its production, often delegated to countries like China, long referred to as the world's workshop.

Alongside this rise of copyright and the legal professions related to intellectual property, copying becomes a true societal phenomenon. It becomes increasingly difficult for an untrained eye to differentiate an original from its copy, whether authorized in the case of reproduction or unauthorized in the case of counterfeiting. Brands thus become increasingly concerned with protecting their manufacturing secrets, whether industrial in nature or not.

Legal and public affairs departments responsible for protecting intellectual property now hold significant positions within their companies.

This trend is reinforced with the arrival of new technologies and digitalization, which systematize copying.

A good of a digital nature is now referred to as content and becomes infinitely copyable. They also partially erase the differentiation between service and good. A content distributor like Netflix offers both goods (the films) and a service (access to these films from home). Subscription becomes gradually the norm to respond to this new form of consumption, which is neither goods nor services but content.

Digital copying becomes the rule, and cybersecurity the holy grail for the new digital giants that supplant those of the industry in the 21st century.

We talk less and less about theft and more and more about hacking, and the digital multinationals are ready to invest enormous sums to hire the best coders, the new guarantors and last bastions of value in the digital age.
