# Development Through Meaning

A healthy collective is one that transforms itself perpetually through the interactions among inter-autonomous individuals and can adjust, as needed and depending on circumstances, its prescribed norms.

This "salutogenic" environment (Richard, 2012) can only exist under governance by individuals, not under laws that are heteronomous, alienating, unfaithful, and incongruent, creating a pathogenic environment that **prevents any means of self-development**.

A. Supiot makes a distinction between governance by laws and governance by individuals: "In a system of governance by laws, the submission of all to general and abstract laws is the condition for the freedom granted to each person" (2015, p. 306).

Standards to follow, as accumulated experience, are an asset as long as they remain **malleable and evolving**, but they become a disadvantage when they transform into rigid, heteronomous, and alienating norms.

"In a system of governance by individuals, these individuals are embedded within networks of dependence. The goal is not the submission of all to the same law but the conformity of each person's behavior to the place they occupy in this network" (p. 307).

**A governance model composed of inter-autonomous individuals creates spaces for discussion, acting as arenas for the realization of meaning** (Frankl, 1988; Pattakos, 2006).

The main purpose of such a discussion space is to bring out the individual and collective meaning of work as well as the organization of work itself. This means not only caring for work but also for profession, as well as the emotional and cognitive dimensions (Clot, 2010; Osty, 2003).

# Meaning of Work

This requires addressing the question of the meaning of work in **its existential dimension, in its subjective, ontological, symbolic, pragmatic, concrete, local aspects, results, quality assessments**... and more.

Thus, the ergological approach delves deeply into work situations rather than personalizing problems or blaming individual shortcomings. It intersects with numerous disciplines like sociology, ergonomics, work psychology, and education sciences.

Ergology is of interest to **both union activists and leaders** who seek to grasp activities and tasks as they are actually performed in human work.

Work, in the context of ergology, encompasses all human activity.

# The Role of Work

Dominique Méda defines "work as a factor of production, as the essence of humanity, and as a system for distributing income, rights, and protections" (Méda, 2004, p. 23).

More specifically, this sociologist and philosopher sees "work as human activity, coordinated and remunerated, consisting of shaping a skill or resource for the use of others, independently or under another’s direction, in exchange for monetary compensation" (2004, p. 31).

This "independent manner" effectively restricts inter-autonomy: this relational autonomy connects a network of men interdependent with one another.

This human activity is situated within the heteronomy of the commercial and neoliberal framework of a **capitalist economy**, in which "the idea of a regulated exchange between the sale of labor power and the rights it enables is central to wage-based society, positioning the equilibrium between the demands of employers and employees at the heart of social dynamics and freeing work from the sole interests of one side or the other" (Méda & Vendramin, 2013, pp. 236-237).

**More generally, one can say that "work is an enactment of human nature that encompasses and restores the full complexity of humanity" (Trinquet, 2009).**

This complexity can manifest in an infinite array of forms, of which neoliberalism is merely one among others. It is to address this human complexity that ergologists seek to create dialogue among the various players within a collective, as [[Yves Schwartz]] puts it. Dialogue within a collective enables the "production of unique knowledge about human activity by the work’s players themselves – and, at the same time, supports the development of alternative options within organizations" (Schwartz & Durrive, 2009, p. 256).
