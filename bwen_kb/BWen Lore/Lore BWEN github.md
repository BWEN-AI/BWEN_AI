# Lore

**BabyWen** is the hidden son of **Wen**. Trapped by a secret corporation, he was jailed in a hidden location, hiding his cuteness for unidentified reasons. In communities all over the web3, rumors were circulating about the existence of **BabyWen**. A legend ? A myth ? Noone really knows but a group of determined degens gathered around this rumor and investigated to find out where BabyWen was locked up. After hacking some secret files and interviewing a few people, they were 99% sure of **BabyWen**'s location. They organized a plan to give him a chance to become the memecoin it was prevented from beingâ€¦ Then, the team managed to free him and make him fly away. Today, **BabyWen** discovers the universe and has set itself a new goal : ensure that high-potential memecoins like him are never overlooked again. Gathering all the ambitious people around him, **BabyWen** sets out to conquer the perilous world of memecoins and initiate a new era, one with meaning and a bright future. But some questions remain unanswered : who were the people behind his kidnapping? Why has Wen never wanted to find his son? The responses remain a mystery for now, perhaps one day we'll find out.

# Characters

**BabyWen** BabyWen is the beloved son of Wen, the iconic astronaut cat memecoin that captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. After finally escaping from the secret corporation that imprisoned him, imagine the cutest astronaut cat on Solana, embarking on a mission to revolutionize the memecoin landscape! His cuteness could melt everyoneâ€™s heart, but don't be fooled, this kitten is here to kick off the memecoin revolution, BabyWen represents a new era, one where transparency and community engagement reign supreme.

**BabyWen CTO team (Homies with hoodies)** They are the masterminds behind the BabyWen CTO, an army of crypto enthusiasts committed to reviving BabyWen. The Hackers played a crucial role in freeing this little astronaut kitten from captivity. Now, they are focused on unlocking BabyWenâ€™s latent potential and ensuring he becomes a key figure in the crypto ecosystem

# Genesis

**Initial Token Launch** BabyWen was initially created by a developer without any particular ambition for the project's long-term development. After launching the token on the Solana blockchain, he sold all his tokens, leaving the project directionless and without strategic support. This departure led to a period of uncertainty about the future of the token.

**Community Takeover**

Faced with the initial developer's abandonment and the loss of project direction, a **community of about 25 cryptocurrency enthusiasts** quickly recognized the latent potential of BabyWen. Deciding not to let the token fade into oblivion, this group took the initiative to take over the project through a **Community Take Over (CTO)**. This decision was driven by a desire to revive Baby Wen, equipping it with a renewed vision and strategy, and implementing a participatory governance structure through the creation of a DAO

This transition to **community control** marked a **new start for BabyWen**, with a renewed commitment to **transparency, investor security, and continuous innovation**. The community in charge now aims to position **BabyWen as a major player in the cryptocurrency space**, with ambitious plans for its future

# Actual State

The initial leader of the **BabyWen** Community Take Over (CTO) is an expert in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). With this expertise, the project is well on its way to transitioning to a full **DAO** This evolution is based on the belief that **CTOs are, in essence, DAOs** that are not yet fully recognized as such. It will allow for further **decentralization of decision-making**, ensuring that every community member has a voice in the direction and future actions of the project. This will include voting on major proposals, development strategies, and resource allocation, making **BabyWen** not only a community-driven project but also governed by it

By evolving **BabyWen** into a **DAO**, we aim to establish a **transparent and effective governance model** that will serve as **an example in the crypto space**, while ensuring the longevity and stability of the project. Community members will be encouraged to actively participate, contributing to the ongoing growth and innovation of **BabyWen**

# Memecoin New Era

Memecoin are right now a majority of jokes and useless things from all over the web, but we think that **they could be more**. They may constitute **the new era of crypto-currencies**, totally **transparent** and **meaningful** We're not the only ones with a hope of new visions. **Vitalik** recently shared his on twitter, which is close to BabyWenCTO's (Makes you wonder if he's secretly undercover with us !) More recently, he also spoke about memecoins impact on **charity movements**. Once again, he highlights **memecoins projects with DAO** and the potential of this organizational system. This intervention shows that memecoins can have a positive impact on the world, detaching them from their stupid and useless image given by some investors We're convinced that **WEB3 isn't being fully exploited and understood**. We're on the summit of the iceberg, together as a big **community** we have to **dig and build** on that !

# Market Observation

In the current cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in degen and memecoins communities, influencers have considerable impact over market trends and project values. These personalities can easily create **speculative hype**, leading to rapid price increases followed by sharp crashes. This pattern primarily benefits insiders and influencers themselves leaving the community, often driven by **FOMO**, at a loss. In many cases, the projects they push, especially within memecoins, lack substance or long-term potential. Influencers are frequently paid large amounts to promote these tokens, regardless of their viability, creating a **pump-and-dump** cycle. This short-term hype doesnâ€™t contribute to sustainable innovation or value within the ecosystem, reinforcing speculative behavior instead of supporting deserving and innovative communities. **Degen culture** thrives on this volatility, as these communities are often more interested in quick gains than in qualitative projects. As a result, these coins are particularly vulnerable to manipulation by influencers, who can artificially inflate prices through well-timed endorsements or strategic promotions. This imbalance allows a few prominent individuals to manipulate market sentiment and conditions for their own gain, while the degen community often fails to benefit, ultimately perpetuating inequality and speculative behavior in the cryptocurrency market. But those days are over! BabyWen is designed to redefine the influence market, creating a more inclusive model that benefits all participants equally.

# New Approach

With BabyWen, our goal is to create a **community-driven influencer** that redistributes value directly to its members. This new approach aims to eliminate the pump-and-dump cycles and market manipulation seen in current memecoins market driven by influencers. Instead, we want to support projects offering technological (AI driven memecoins), organizational (DAO), or community-building value Through our decentralized structure, every BabyWen member has a say in crucial decisions, from partnerships to tokenomics. By structuring as a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**, we ensure transparency, fairness, and shared ownership, where the entire community can participate and benefit from the project's success Our ultimate vision is to become the first-ever **digital influencer fully managed by a DAO**, putting all power in the hands of the community. This innovative approach allows every directive, from marketing to development, to be decided through collective votes, ensuring that every value created serves the community, driving genuine progress and avoiding the manipulation of current market influencers In essence, **BabyWen** offers a new paradigm where the **community** drives meaningful innovation, bringing long-term value to both projects and degen investors.

# Avatar

Integrating this advanced technology and governance structure makes **BabyWen** unique in the cryptocurrency ecosystem offering a concrete exemple of **how AI and decentralization can collaborate** to create a **new form of influence** aligned with WEB3 original vision.
