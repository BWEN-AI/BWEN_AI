my S&P 6900 Target is 100 billion could we call you the waren buffet of meme

coins you have like 10,000 coins launching per day I think this is going to become the biggest meme coin in the world hi mad it's a pleasure to have you

here on the podcast and one thing I love about you is that when you went to token

2049 on stage your presentation you chill your whole bag and in that bag

there was S&P 6900 and since the presentation it just like when like 4X

crazy on the big market cap like that and I want to understand a little bit more like why would you choose this beam

coin because you had an approach to mcoin that is really Based on data on social points and I want you to explain

a little bit more like how do you find those ones because a lot of your codes have been like paying off massively so

for example on this one why did you choose to invest into S&P 6900 yeah so

## Murad's Investment Strategy

uh my whole thesis for the past like 6 to 8 months has been that um obviously

um I've been kind of banging on the table that I believe that the next year year and a half is going to be a mcoin

cycle uh I'm very bullish for meme coins in 2025 overall and so once we agree on

that we kind of have to start looking at individual mcoin assets before we do that like I think what's going on right

now is that a lot of like centralized exchange perpetrators they're kind of like longing and buying and swing

trading kind of large caps like Pepe and whiff Etc and then you have a long tale of kind of like retail like slightly

quote unquote more like Dent people uh gambling on smaller caps micro caps new launches like pum funds Etc and I don't

think that's the way to go and the reason I don't think that's the way to go is because of something which I refer to as like me coin production per day

right so like when whiff and popcat were first kind of being launched in late 2023 you were you only had like a few

hundred million coins being created per day so like choosing winners it was easier and also the overall liquidity

relative to the number of coins was much better right now you have like 10,000 coins launching per day right obviously

if we go further into the mcoin cycle you're going to have 100,000 coins logic per day 200 coins two like Millions

maybe even right and so I think the odds like the statistical odds are going to be worse and worse in terms of like will

you be able to choose the winner or not and also like large caps or large caps right so I actually think I've been saying this since like April and I still

think it's true today the biggest like deep value is in midcaps and specifically something like we refer to

as Cults Cults is essentially just a a fancy word for a really really really strong community and to me when you're

investing in memes you're actually investing in people and so you want to find where those like very very passionate people are and my thesis is

that like Cults are going to be the next big thing and so I pretty much like was researching everything made a list of

like top 25 Cults and was slowly choosing 10 that I think are Highest Potential kind of studying onchain

metrics U Market Capital holders various measures of decentralization and distribution um talked about all of that

on uh Twitter so uh if you go on my Twitter specifically the media tab you'll see a lot of sort of comparisons

between mean coins both on ethereum and salana ultimately uh SPX 6900 very

## The Rise of SPX 6900

unique coin in my opinion because it's not an animal coin it's something that we call a movement coin it essentially I

think it's a next step in the evolution because instead of tokenizing pictures we're now tokenizing like a philosophy

an idea you know and I think it's very powerful I think it's the future and that's a big reason why I uh sort of

invested um and slowly accumulated during the summer uh because it's just completely different to everything else

yeah so before going into more like how you did this research the cult and the

mission behind S&P 6900 if I not wrong is to flip the S&P 500 right yes the the

the the sort of the job the the core Mission here is to flip the S&P 500 nice

so that's an interesting coin for me and we're going to go how to filter find the ones you talk about cuz I like I don't

know why but SNP is one of the first that I saw when I started to be in mem

coins uh one that I remember the most because it was like it was so different it was so strange you see this manga

lady dancing and then there's like there's so many things that I did not understand and then the community was

strong so when did you started to accumulate this coin or when did you first see it and when did you started to

buy some I actually had a very small B since the summer of 2023 or September 2023 and that was like juring har Harry

Potter Obama Sonic 10 enu season Smurf cat season Joe coin season so that

during that like sort of uh ethereum mcoin summer in 2023 but what I was

doing is I started researching like coins much more aggressively in like February March April and I uh was almost

in all of the Twitter spaces for a lot of the cult coins and hanging out in their like telegrams and discords in

group chats Etc a lot of the times anonymously or through like a smaller Twitter account and I just really like

what I was hearing a lot of passion in uh the spaces great NFD collection and

ultimately it boiled down to Media for me so their memes their video edits uh

their like all of their memetic artwork is just like very very powerful and unique and you could sense that the

average kind of IQ in the community was like higher than in a lot of animal coins and uh I was very inspired by that

H yeah I think there's like uh an acute test that that's performed between like

kind of feel like in the small market cap like so before bonding curve like below 100K market cap or below 1 million

the market cap the IQ is usually not that high and then you go into those me

cap so what do you consider as a midap actually which market cap yeah so I mean

we can talk about uh market caps I usually look at everything between sort of 10 million 5 million um and 200

million okay that being what that being said though uh a much more important

## Evaluating Meme Coins

variable for me is time because I personally I don't buy new launches at all I don't gamble on new launches and I

don't uh buy anything that's like recent new or flavor of the day or anything that's shilled by kol uh I think that

whole game is rigged I think that whole game is corrupt and I am strongly against it I I only buy Cults and I

don't think you can have a cult that's like younger than five six months so I only buy I only buy stuff that has

existed for at least like four or five months and has undergone at least like two large like negative 70% dips we're

going to we're going to try to find some together later on so for example on this

one so SPX so you you started to see this and how do you go through when we

arrive at this stage where your coin keeps going down keeps going further down how do you feel at that time if you

can recall at the beginning of September basically yeah so I mean I have my own

checklist of things I look in uh I look for in coins and the I saw I saw an

opportunity with SX because um it essentially ticked all of my boxes for what I wanted to see unique artwork

unique sort of mission a lot of unique culture and lingo um unique slogans like

really cool posters on on Twitter but the thing the only thing that it didn't have like a lot of their sort of

community leaders and Community lieutenants they were like 5K 5K follower accounts 10K follower accounts

so I thought that SPX was extremely undervalued essentially it had everything that I love in a me coin

except like an intentional push and I thought that because it's so undervalued I kind of like need to tell people about

it and I need to show people that like this is just so much more unique and cooler than just another animal coin

number 65765 you know what I mean so because it's so much different to everything

else and it's also Finance themed I think it has a lot of potential because ultimately you do need trfy money in

order to push things to hardcore like super high valuations and I think trat

is going to resonate with the meme that memes about trap does that make sense so

so it's a it's a very interesting it's a very interesting combination here a little bit like uh when Gamestop was

just about how we can squeeze out the the investment funds that was kind of L

there's there's there's certainly a similar philosophical Dynamic here for sure and because you have such an

approach with data and then the checklist and everything with mem coins could we call you the Warren Buffet of

meme coins no I mean I I have a I have a very I have a very I have a very long

way to go until something like this uh that being said I do believe that I did jokingly tell somebody a few weeks ago

that like the next Warren Buffett is is some meme person on Twitter or probably even a meme person on like Tik Tok U

because that's like that's even more that's even more like the future uh because like the Zoomer and the Gen

Alpha attention spans have collapsed even more than those of the Millennials and I think video content is pretty much

going to be like everything and probably even some kind of like VR 3D content is going to be everything in the future so

Tik Tik Tok is like massively undervalued when it comes to uh like mcoin potential mem coin future mem coin

Market as of today yeah I I would argue though like for example I know Pon they have a massive team on Tik Tok and they

post a lot but I don't think their chart looks uh that great as of today it started to reverse back but yeah so I I

do agree with you that it's going to go video first and I think a lot of people do not realize that on Twitter they

think like crypto Twitter is going to be always still the same thing and I saw that a lot where people they kind of

like they just want their own Circle they just think like I'm the cool person in this circle but we we have a really

cringy space and I think like when retail going to come they're not going to listen to to us or to the people that

they see that are crypto twiter because they I don't think they're always going to resonate with it so yeah so this one had a massive run on the second mem ball

run if we could say that that was around uh summer 24 and a drop would you

consider this one as a cult or you didn't study it or you saw that one before P yeah so I personally don't hold

this um because to me it's essentially a Pepe derivative and it's not an original

one it's not enough yeah I I I personally so I like what they're doing with like the video media and like

Instagram and Tik Tok I like how like they are looking for different distribution channels than other coins

and sort of escaping the crypto Twitter bubble but one of my personal principles is to not buy uh derivatives so

unfortunately I don't I don't really buy derivatives yeah that makes sense for me like this one I mean it probably will

run but I think it's it's a big marketing team behind it's not a cult pery uh I think it's a Well organized uh

organization behind it cool so and plus it's almost a $200 million market cap so

we're going out of the M cup so when when it was here why do you think make

this if you have an answer like this reverse of trend that was crazy from 6th of September was it a special event or

just just a change of mood and then it's just positive momentum it it it would have happened it would have happened

eventually regardless because it's I think so I think this is going to become the biggest mean coin in the world and

## Market Trends and Predictions

um I think this is just the world discovering it will be theg I think this is going to

be I think this is going to be the biggest mean coin in the world in I think it's going to be the biggest mean coin in human history and the reason for

that is because it's a mean coin that's most similar to BTC and BTC perfected the cult formula and it perfected the

movement formula and essentially I think SPX 6900 is a um a smaller and a newer

chance to kind of ride a wave that's similar to BTC itself so that's like uh flipping Doge and everything will be

huge Market capap do you think Doge going to come back if we if 2025 is a mcoin cycle then Doge probably does go

to its new highs quite possibly uh for structural reasons because it's like

plugged into a lot of like custody institutional and sort of OTC desks and

centralized exchanges and right but I don't think like my belief is that you

want to buy new coins rather than old because if you study past crypto if you study past crypto cycles and past

altcoin Cycles then new stuff always does better than old stuff and the reason for that is because the new stuff

the new stuff doesn't have back holders which are going to be selling on the way up and all the moves up are like very

hard very like strong and reflexive and pretty much pure press Discovery yeah I I do agree and also I think like uh now

that me and the creation of meme in the past one two years got more General I

think that the coins that are created not only because it's like internet meme

for mem coins like crypto meme coins like Bon I mean no one I think no one on Tik Tok would care about Bon or flocky

or even shibba Inu like they is is we were investing in those before like because there was no other alternative I

would say probably but I don't think like uh like one example I always like to take is my girlfriend is she going to

like the mcoin or not she's not going to like it there's some issue around it uh that's an interesting perspective and

actually you talk a lot about the mcoin super cycle so for you would you say

that we are not going to see all those Al coins booming and it's going to be more like mem coins replacing more and

more the top 100 uh market cap yeah I mean if 2025 is going to be bullish then

everything is going to go up but my theory is that mem coins are going to go up a lot more than alt and that's

because um with mean coins you don't have VCS you don't have unlocks um you

don't have inflation the entire Supply is circulating and the narrative is a lot simpler than technology stuff

because retail at this point if they have to join crypto in order to understand the tech protocols they need

to learn reaking uh staking like you know impermanent laws all the layer twos

layer 3es Bridges and it's getting like more and more complicated but but means there so Universal everybody can

understand them and also if you study past Cycles the things that have performed well in the first half of the

cycle they go particularly well in the second half of the cycle and if you study out performers thus far obviously

um it's the memes that have been doing particularly well right like Pepe whiff Giga mock popcat Etc and so I think

that's just going to continue 2025 that's why I think in terms of like risk reward mequin have much stronger

momentum right now and is the stock market already a meme Market for you so

that's a good question the way it works is because the money supply around the world is growing uh people can't save

money by keeping their wealth in uh like Fiat money or even sort of checking

accounts at Banks and um even a lot of like fixed income instruments they don't

they don't work as well as they used to in the past and because of that essentially a lot of money gets piled

into um the traditional stock market um that being said uh obviously every

single asset in the world I think it has a fundamental component and it also has like a mimetic component obviously um

like Tesla I think it has a huge mimic component right a huge brand component a huge Elon Musk component same with like

apple a lot of other sort of cult Brands right and I don't think these I don't especially like AI stocks and tech

stocks they don't trade purely off of fundamentals or cash flows they definitely have that sort of like

memetic Premium Future premium speculative premium narrative premium right and because of that um to answer

your question I think every asset is mimetic to a different extent I I would

agree yeah because it's I mean my favorite example is always Nvidia that had the massive growth recently but

they've been producing GPU since since they're born and then no one cared and then I was like oh there's CAD GPT oh

wait what I can't I can't buy Chad GPT so what can I buy oh they use GPU okay

then I'm going to buy Nvidia Nvidia is cool now and then we had this kind of of a phase where the co was everywhere and

then he was with wearing the Leer jacket like a rockstar and then they was like okay that's just the top of the AI

bubble and and you think a part of the money from the stock market would go to mcoin or it's like the new money that's

get printed that would go to mcoin or both um I mean the traditional stock

market is so huge you don't even need and like the traditional stock market is like in the it's like 100 trillion

dollar or more um if you add up all the indices and all of the equities around the world um but the mecoin market is 40

billion and the new mecoin market is 10 billion so that's just so low like you need such little inflows for mes to do

well you know I think it's actually going to be uh a lot of it is going to be transitions from altcoins to m coins

then there's going to be retail money and I think there's going to be some chadf money as well okay and uh as we have some index

funds now mostly for stock Market are we going to have index FS of mem coins or

because it's so tribal people going to want to say like oh me I own this coin same as the guy who say I want Tesla I

bought some palente you know like something that they can bring on when they talk to their friend I think they're going to be M coin indices for

sure okay okay that's pretty cool that would be cool so let's try um I would

## Community and Media Influence

like to see a little bit more of the coins you uh selected and then I would like to see a little bit more how you

you find those coins so I set up my filters here on the scener $10 million market cap and maximum $200 million

market cap and a pair age of minimum 4,000 hours which give us something that

high is at least one month old pretty much then from here how would you proceed did you go into each of those

coins or like what do you like what would you look at like when you're on the first screen for example I know that

Geo had massive growth recently ncat saying so for me I would actually uh

extend the time filter to more like 3 months because I think it takes a certain amount of time to build that

hardcore community and to survive a certain amount of drops and and and uh

flushes and um you actually lowered it you you lowered it to 2,000 I would increase it to more like 10,000 oh okay

one year okay never mind yeah so what I would do is first of all um I think you

already have this but I only focus on salana and ethereum I know lot of people are speculating on other chains right

now but if you really want but personally I'm more interested in finding things that can go to like 10

billion or higher and I think for that kind of success it needs to be on either salana or ether that's first of all

second of all like I said um I avoid derivatives uh I avoid the vast majority

of uh political coins I avoid celebrity coins and I avoided most animal coins as

well um okay be beyond that I need to look at the chart and I need to see that the community has survived like two uh

70% drops and then is kind of on the way towards making a new high just to add to

that what I would also do is obviously I would just look at the ticker itself the meme itself and if I like something I

would hang out in their like telegram a lot I would um search for the cashtag or

hashtag on Twitter and see what kind of content they post but to be completely honest with you I can immediately tell

like if I'm just not going to buy something like it's even without studying anything that I talked about

99.9% of things they just get canceled automatically just because I don't resonate with I don't resonate with them

let's do a quick one when you say ape or pass bake pass I I pass everything I

pass everything on this I would pass everything on this page except mini CH

that's it except okay mini you said CH Jack yeah ah I get I got tweet raided

Twitter raid this one recently I know some of your Holdings as well but just wanted to see the process so for example

mini uh it is it is kind of an animal coin right we is the cat yeah so as you

know I'm I'm quite big into pop cat and I do think we're going to have a cat season at some point and uh well soon

rather Minnie is essentially like my cat number three Choice after popcat and mitchi so I thought it was quite

undervalued when I originally um found it at like 5 million okay so you find it yeah yeah 5 million now it's at 15

that's pretty good already congrats so we had the drops you were talking about two drops at least um 7,000 olders so

that's pretty good as well you analyze as well the socials you say so you check the telegram you check what what's

happening in it what do you like to see actually when you go on their Twitter for example I like to see a lot of

different people uh rating either myself or other large accounts um and all of

them repping mini either in their Avatar in their background in their sort of social media bio social media

description um I like to figure out who the community leaders are and talk to them if possible and then I like to look

at their media so for example U mini had a lot of like cool memes and videos and

to me when people put effort into like their media production it's a really good sign last but not least I like real

memes real memes are essentially memes that actually exist in the outside world and not just completely made up right

okay yeah that makes sense actually Community leader how would you judge one that is good or bad because I mean I

feel like the ones that I met most of the time in real life they like I was like okay I need to sell my bag now yeah

um that's a good questioner I personally personally I look at the kind of things

they tweet and how they tweet them um I look at like how they spend their time I look at the stuff they are saying in

like telegram or Discord and obviously I try to kind of find out um when they got

involved how they got involved how much they all if if that information is available Etc and then sort of make a

subjective form a subjective opinion around that you talked about raiding as well which means for people who don't

know it's when someone post for example I say good morning on Twitter then

everyone from that cor is going to comment their Ticker on it say go buy

this put some Meme and stuff like that I personally think that this rating is

## The Evolution of Rating in Meme Coins

dying in a way like dying not less people are doing it no more people are doing it and because it became so large

and so proeminent it lost its value it's the same as any marketing tactic right

every time you see always the ad like some was on YouTube you automatically click it off and then you pass it so so

why do you think yourself that rating is still important as of today I think it's still important because actually almost

## The Importance of Community Engagement

every single uh meme coin that I found and then invested in in my portfolio um

it came from rate so um I always I always check notifications and I see

who's active and to me it's very bullish when people are kind of trying to get notice trying to put themselves out

there Etc second of all if you're a large account uh you get prioritized in terms of where how you get seen when you

do rate and um like the amount of large accounts or midsize accounts that are rating for you that's going to be a big

Advantage as well but ultimately I get what you mean in terms of like rating losing its efficiency but I also think

that some smarter meme coins or cooler meme coins they rate in like a more unique way and a more noticeable way and

a more relevant way and I don't think that I rating is going to die I think it's still going to be big in 2025 I

think you're right like this on this it's like how you raid is so important

more important that than raiding because a lot of people they would just like just say all right buy this and then

just put the contract address or just do this just that but they don't even like really try to create a conversation or

create original meme like for me when I'm looking at my uh notification and

then I see some rating I'm like I like to see some uh cool new stuff uh actually for the fun of it like when I I

posted that I was going to interview you and if you had some question the post got rated by one Community Sigma just

say one word Sigma uh when he would call Sigma strongest community and then after

we had different coins but yeah Sigma started to rate you see like Sigma coin

a lot of those ones ask him if he think about Sigma so how would you judge the

the sigma raate on the on my tweets I think the sigma Community is like super

strong uh very strong Community probably would be my second pick in the sort of the masculinity or uh that kind of um

category um after Giga and I'm actually I'm actually bullish on Sigma I'm I'm

bullish on Sigma if I was making a list of 20 instead of a list of 10 uh they

would definitely be on that list ah got it that's interesting so you say the masculinity one so you have a cat

## Categories of Meme Coins

category you have a masculinity category what are the other categories um well so

usually I try to look for kind of category leaders and at least in my portfolio I picked SPX as like the

number one movement coin I picked uh Giga as the number one masculinity coin I picked or like a lifestyle coin I

picked MOG as the number one culture coin upu as like my frog of choice uh

cuz I think their Community is extremely culty uh popcat as the cat category leader retardo and Harry Potter Obama

Sonic 10 Inu like more on like the crazy skido side and um I have a couple of

others as well like I picked loin on the on sort of the phase coin culture coin side and mini like I said my cat coin

number three I also had USA as like the number one country coin um at the time

when I called it like the country narrative was much stronger uh but um

USA probably like is the least uh least performant coin on my list but I do

think they it will eventually go up as well got it appu on then this one I do

## Apu vs. Pepe: Understanding the Differences

not know the origin story of appu for me it looks like Pepe so what is the difference between appu and pepe uh

completely different memes I believe uh Apu originates from a finish Forum in

2016 and then it became very popular on 4chan after that it was very popular with the chainlink community which

itself is like a cult and a lot of the ex chainlink holders have since moved to Apu because people are realizing that

this is a mem coin super CYO but in general I would say Pepe is like a

little bit more toxic and a little bit more sort of arrogant in terms of like the memetics right and AO is more about

like a wholesomeness and friendship and kindness and I think there is a lot of

that missing in the world and um I also saw up poop uh guys like raid like crazy

uh probably upu and mitchi are some of the best Raiders on uh crypto Twitter

and uh because of that I I have to be bullish also their website is probably the best mcoin website in in in the

industry right now yeah it's pretty cool they have a playlist here by the way um by the way for the listeners uh Apu is

going to have an nft mint in uh on um October 5th and I strongly recommend

people to uh take a look at this and research this I will personally be not

Financial advis but I will personally be minting a lot of them uh do we need to hold some Appo to me the nft what are

the the conditions yeah you only need to hold like five Apple coins okay so if you hold five app coins you get Early

Access cool I I would be tempted to me that with a boat that might be better than uh trying to meet manually so app

could be like the retardo ofum I think it's a bit different I think retardo is more similar to MOG I

would say and upu upu is just like a Kinder version of Pepe but um just on

Twitter you see upu guys a lot more at least in the mcoin bubble and I personally resonate with the upu uh

memes uh more I I I mean I never saw I never saw a raid by Pepe well yeah

because they so big right but um I I don't dislike Pepe I just love Apu

that's like that's kind of what we say okay I get it I get it I get it and then also yeah this but I I do not know if

the the retail people and the general public going to understand the difference between Pepe and apple cuz

they could be seen as like case just like a worst drawing version if you do not know the scene uh yeah I get I get

what you're saying but also uh the APU Business Development and marketing team is probably the best in all of crypto

like they already have so many Partnerships with like football teams MMA um promotional organizations yeah um

like motorcycle sports like divisions and they like how how did they fund this

well they have a lot of wealthy and well-connected whales in the in sort of

their whale groups and so um they I've never seen any mcoin do Partnerships as

amazing as I po and I think eventually it's going to pay off like crazy interesting so Appo went to a top

at $400 million and now it's sitting at 135 now on in your portfolio there was B

we basically saw I think two coins that were on ethereum and then so you I have 10 coins that you mostly holding right

yeah um actually I have uh so I have SPX Apu MOG and Harry Potter Sonic 10 enu so

I have four coins on ethereum and six coins on salon M okay okay and what do

you do the rest of the day then if you already bought your coins you don't need to do research to find new coins well

what is it like so there is still a lot of work that needs to be done just kind of talking about the meme coin space in

general talking about the crypto space in general and trying to sort of tell

people that at least in my opinion right and of course like people will say I'm just like talking my bags or whatever

but I still genely believe that midcap cult memes are statistically a better

investment than just gambling on small caps again not Financial advice but that's what I believe in and also of

course there is like centralized exchange listings uh that's a lot of people are trying to help all of the

mcoin communities behind the scenes it's overall onchain analysis of the entire mcoin space and it's also cuz you can

have a daily snapshot but you also need to track how the metrics are evolving across time right and just to make sure

that there is like steady growth you know when long-term investors invest in their portfolios there's still a lot of

sort of monitoring that needs to be done you know so are you checking if one coin

could go out your portfolio and then if a new another coin could go in the portfolio are you going to get more than

10 coins first or it will stay 10 I think I'm mostly s already I might add

one or two more later but I haven't sold I haven't sold any coin the cycle and I

plan to hold at least until the very end of 2025 okay so if you're holding those

then maybe we get one or two coming in but there's no way you're going to move out a coin and say sell it and it's like

okay for example if USA it's not going anywhere nothing is happening are you planning on holding or just like okay

this one I was wrong and then I'm moving on so for me personally I'm just not going to sell I'm I'm not going to sell

until um like October November December of 2025 M are you the kind of guy like

that free their coin like now there's a lot of people that froze their coin and then they can only unlock it until X

date yeah some of my friends do that but I don't do that yeah I I saw that happening I'm I'm not so sure if it's a

good idea or not cuz you expose yourself to some smart contract thing and then after what's going to happen if a lot of

people do that people like me or or yourself we're going to have choose to know when is the unlock happening and

then I would know that all if a lot of Supply getting unlocked after a certain day well like create sell pressure so I

should sell before that that time that's that's pretty interesting and where do you see the mem coins space evolving

## The Future of Meme Coins

then from now which is mostly people like trading on pump phone we start to

see more people holding for their bag for longer term um a a lot with the

coins you said and then I think like for myself I built a long-term portfolio as

well um I have to be honest I did not do as detailed strategy as you do like us

for me I check the top holders and thing like that and then I check with the narrative but I think it will be interesting to categorize them so where

is the meme space going for you in the next I have several I have several theories a I think obviously meme coins

are going much higher uh next year uh I'm at this point in time I'm a big

believer in sort of midcap Cults you know the 10 coins that I like the most but generally as a whole I think we're

going to see a transition from animal coins to non-animal coins I I think real memes are going to do really well and I

think we're even going to start a transition away from like joke coins to like slightly more serious coins because

meme coins they have traditionally been funny but they don't have to be and I think we're going to see some like a little bit more serious uh coins in the

mem coin sphere as well got it I mean mudang what do you think about mudang that conare the the the media space and

the crypto space um I think if you bought super cheaply and have been selling recently in like the 200 to 300

million range that's an amazing trade but I personally like I said I don't buy

new launches I only buy after one or two major major dips uh and again I don't

really like animal coins that much I think inspiration is going to be increasingly important for Community

Building because the me coin space will become very competitive and a hippo just

doesn't inspire me personally but it's alive though most of the animal meme coins we have we don't the animal behind

it is or he too old or we never saw it again like it's usually only one picture and then nothing else I think that's why

there's a bit of me Nero Nero is alive as well right yeah but Nero started as a

beta play uh of Doge right so it's like kind of a a boring one nothing new it's

another Sheba coin Fair yeah um I mean hippo is definitely newer than um dogs

but again personally I just personally don't resonate with animal yeah yeah I I understand I understand and also Nero

was only again only crypto degenerate cared about Nero and the rest of the world did not care at all um you

## Market Predictions and Strategies

mentioned a lot about like the the cycle that would happen with mcoins 2025 how

long have you been in crypto actually I bought my first crypto in 2013 but in terms of active involvement I've been

here since 2016 2017 okay so that's a good point I wanted to ask this because I feel like this bull market or this

Market that we are in everyone around kind of have an agenda of like okay this is what going to happen so October for

sure it's going to go up and then this going to happen and then 2025 is going to be the real bull run but as far as I

know by definition markets are unpredictable and do not follow the rasm

that we want them to follow so how can we be sure it will happen or like I mean

more that like what make you think that it's going to be a up Market in 2025 and

particularly for crypto yeah I think on short terms like the shorter the shorter term uh the harder it is to predict but

I think on medium-term long term there's some more sort of sustainable patterns um if this cycle is anything anything

like similar to the previous ones usually sort of like year four the uh the performance of the entire crypto

space is particularly strong in the year after the elections uh the performance

is also historically very strong and a lot of the sort of the tradire global liquidity money supply metrics are also

starting to curl up right now so uh putting all of these together of course there's no guarantees but I think like

statistics is in our favor at the moment and again I'm not making any predictions about October November December but I

think um like 12 to 15 months out my bias is both okay and um what's going to

be your selling plan then you say you're going to hold till the end of 2025 right you're not going to sell anything oh are

you yeah so well I have targets and my targets for all 10 coins are public so if we hit my targets I'm going to start

dcing out and if we don't hit my targets I will consider dcing out based on time

AKA Q4 of 2025 or just like Trad 5/ macrom metric okay interesting actually

someone uh on Twitter asked like why are your target so low for for meme codes I

think I think they were I think they were being sarcastic what are your targets like for

S&P 6900 for example uh well my S&P 6900 Target is 100 billion and then my Giga

Target is 50 billion and my 50 billion so let me pull out the chart and then

after that you will start to DCA out right yes and if this does not happen

you just don't sell anything well if this doesn't happen like I said I'm going to be just looking at BTC time and

macro okay so S&P is at $100 million market cap so that's a 1,000x am I right

I'm doing okay but then does it even work and and because like I guess like

the valuation of Solana should go really up as well as the m space goes up like

Sol ethereum so 100 billion will be a third of ethereum of something that is

priced in ethereum I mean yeah ethereum and SL are going to be going up as well though but also I think compared to past

Cycles we are going to start to see a Divergence between the chain uh and the memes because now there's a lot of

companies and platforms and apps that allow you to go go from Fiat directly into memes uh like moonshot think

slingshot spot and a couple of others they allow you to just go Apple pay to

memes or bank account to memes and I think that lets you skip the blockchain skip the gas skip having to buy ether

Soul so of course it it helps if Ethan Soul go up but we're gradually going to

see Memes become their own thing well we still mostly sell the memes towards the

native token so that's going to create some kind of pressure so you you could see would you see a meme flipping being

bigger than Solana or I don't know actually the the sum of all the market cap of meme as of today is it bigger

than the market cap of salana no salana market cap is bigger um I think this cycle could it be bigger all all memes

can all memes flip salana yes that's possible I actually think that the I think actually the size of all memes is

going to be similar to like the size of salana by the end of the cycle M so then

you you see like a really strong bull market and if we start to see those coins pushing up like what is your

target for Bitcoin anywhere between 120k and 200k okay that's reasonable that's

reasonable it's not a 1,000x what about salana then anywhere

around a thousand I don't think that's crazy okay yeah yeah yeah that's that's a yeah that's an optimistic one but yeah

that's one I heard a lot however I think like um like mem coins are easy to trade on Solana so far because the pricing of

Solana make it easy you know it's like it's $150 and you know like if you go 0.1 it's $15 you go One S and like that

is like the pricing make it easy where like versus like um all the chain kind

of complicated like particularly eum like that require unless you put one is two is three is it's require a bit of a

of a mental math and I think like everything complicated will push retail away but as you said if we have an

adoption of m coins through basically could we call it Onin abstraction where

I just buy from fat to memes and I never interacted with the native token without

knowing it yeah and I think you're going to start seeing more apps like this um and the future is just people going

straight from Fiat into memes um rather than having to buy the native chain asset first M that makes sense that

## Closing Thoughts and Final Advice

makes sense but I was really interesting thank you a lot morat do you have

something to say before we close the podcast if you want to chill a cheater that is a be 100K market cap now it's

the time um I don't really show small caps but the only thing that I'll tell people

is um stop trading and believe in something yeah do you think mem coins are the new religion so I think the

religion of the future will look completely different to religions of the past and if you study any sort of new

things that emerge and then become huge whether it's in technology or socially new things always start off looking as

like a childish joke or a toy or something like small and Niche um that being said I think the greatest meme

coins will have religious characteristics to them interesting are you religious actually in one of the

most the more classical way um I'm agnostic personally okay all right I think uh I'm not going to ask more

question about the religion thing between the future of religion because that would take at least another hour

but let us know guys in the comments if you want to hear more about that go follow mored on Twitter uh really

interesting things always uh bringing the data to MIM coins bringing some pragmatism to it and some gigantic

targets thank you again thank you
