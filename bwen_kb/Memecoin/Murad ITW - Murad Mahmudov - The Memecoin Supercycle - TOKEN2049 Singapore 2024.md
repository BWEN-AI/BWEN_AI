I'm here to talk about the mcoin super

cycle why it's happening and why it will

continue so the mcoin supercycle is not

just a prediction about the future it's

already happening if you look at the

year-to-date performance of all the

major crypto categories they are mixed

bag with a lot of disappointments and a

lot of under underperforming tokens but

if you look at the bottom right of the

screen you will see that mem coins in

particular are dominating uh in terms of

outperformance right now old memes are

doing well and new memes are doing

particularly

amazing the era of all crypto assets

moving up in unison is over um we're all

going to make it is dead this is a

natural step in the evolution of the

space um if you look at the first three

pages of coin market cap you will see

that only 43 tokens

have outperformed Bitcoin year-to date

and does any category stand out you will

see that 13 out of the top 20 are meme

coins so why is the mem coin cycle

happening there's reasons internal to

the space and reasons external to the

space so first of all there's a massive

overproduction of tokens right um

there's 600,000 new tokens being

launched uh in 2024 and this was just as

of April uh and there's over 5 half

th000 tokens being launched per day

um they extremely inflated altcoin

valuations at centralized exchange

listing time right Let's ignore the

software for a moment Founders get zero

cost basis on the token VCS and Angels

get to buy a large percentage of the

token cheaply and then centralized

exchanges market makers Twitter K's

Twitter th artists telegram callers

YouTubers they all get either tokens

Supply or dollars in order to talk about

the token right and ultimately retail is

the exit liquidity for this when you're

launching A10 billion valuations um

retail is the exit liquidity that

ultimately gets dumped

on all of the altcoin price appreciation

has been relegated to the private rounds

uh this is what you typically see in

tier one VCB infrastructure tokens this

year all of the all of the fdv grows it

happens in the shadows it happens in the

private Market

by the time something gets listed it

gets listed at 5 10 15 billion valuation

so retail does not get to benefit from

this at all um so they deliberately I

believe they deliberately list altcoins

at extremely high initial valuations so

that after even after the initial

negative 90% which is inevitable the

seed investors are still up 100x while

retail mistakenly think that it's a

discounted

bargain um all of the 2024 Launches on

binance are literally down only every

single one except two one of them is

whiff which is barely up since listing

and the other is Jupiter which is

obviously mcoin trading infrastructure

like that in and of itself should be

sending a signal here gamey just as a

sample category not looking particularly

great either um there's very few

non-speculative daps that have been hits

in this industry and we've had smart

contracts for 10 years so if you look at

Unis swap pump fund poly Market fantasy

top Jupiter Phantom dydx GMX hyper

liquid roll bit Shuffle blur tensor

salana and big parts of defi literally

all of this and these are probably the

highest pmf products in crypto history

right they're all either directly

related to or dependent on

speculation 99% of altcoins don't

justify their valuations and they often

say that it's regulations which is the

main reason why they don't Revenue share

but it's not in their interest to do so

because there are many projects that

literally make $500 in fees per day

while trading at5 to1 billion uh

valuations right and goes without saying

that these infr tokens aren't going to

become monetary stores of value either

so if these tokens make it easy for to

be valued in Microsoft Excel by

investment banker types then it will be

obvious to everybody that they are 100x

overvalued they need the narrative they

need the mimetic premium to support

their overvalued market caps

and the crypto token markets don't seem

to Value Revenue over hype either this

is a list of tokens that are most

frequently hyped as kind of like large

and legitimate Revenue producers which

they are but their respective tokens

they haven't been they haven't been

doing particularly well either this year

the two exceptions are banana which

people use to trade meme coins and AA

which obviously benefited from bases mem

coin season as well so Revenue creates a

floor but it also creates a ceiling um

and this is probably the most important

binance research themselves have pointed

that there are $155 billion worth of

unlocks coming in the next 5 years that

is a huge headwind to anything

technological VCS can publicly embrace

the mcoin thesis because it would pose

risk to the valuations of tech alts a

lot of which haven't even launched yet

right and so just a reminder mem coins

are already fully circulating and they

have no unlocks last but not least Doge

shib Pepe and whiff have already proven

to the market Consciousness that these

things can go to 550 or even a hundred

billion doll type valuations and so

people are finally waking up to the idea

that the token is the real product and

the crypto industry is a token

production industry that is masquerading

as the software production

industry many new launches look like

this 80% of the supply in the hands of

insiders this is completely broken um go

go without saying that this does not

build community on the other end of the

spectrum you have something that's much

more organic if you look at the most

organic and bottom up meme coins you

will see that they effectively enabled

poor hodlers to get rich who

subsequently become unpaid full-time

evangelists for the project and I think

in the next couple of years you're

essentially going to see this

ideological war uh and for for a crypto

industry that's so obsessed with

decentralization it's crazy how

centralized some of the out coin

Holdings have become so the entire token

Market cannot sustain itself without

retail inflows but the vast majority of

retail never cared about technology why

would they care about that what does

retail care about some blockchain being

slightly more private no do they care

about some blockchain being slightly

faster no do they care about ZK snarks

no what do they care about let's be real

they care about making money they care

about having fun and they care about

belonging somewhere so memecoins are not

a vampire attack against crypto Tech

mcoins are vampire attack against

cryptotech tokens big difference so both

memecoins and altcoins are actually

selling you the same product it's the

token not the software and mem coins are

a Counterattack of the trenches right

all tokens doesn't matter if it's a tech

token or a meme token they're tables at

the casino so why should we play at your

tables when we can create our own tables

right meme coins are a spiritual

Reincarnation of the 2017 Ico wave but

in a new

form and uh even cryptotech projects if

you if you look at past history that

managed to create cult-like communities

and outperformed for a couple of Cycles

in a row are those that either had an

Ico or had some other way to let retail

buy cheap before a major runup why does

this matter because when you're trading

attention a Relentless Community is the

secret sauce that you need to look for

and if you don't enable poor people to

get rich then you have no community and

in my opinion air drops don't build

community either so there's also

external reasons for all this even four

years even from four years ago the world

is changing the world outside of crypto

inflation is going rampant money supply

is growing fast the prices of everyday

goods are skyrocketing um AI is going to

be coming for your jobs not even stem

degrees or computer science degrees are

a safe way out anymore

um wealth and in income inequality are

as high as they've ever been and the

situation outside of the developed world

is even

worse um accelerating loneliness

accelerating sexlessness accelerating

mental health issues all of these are

going

up um the amount of time spent online

obviously growing year by year uh

there's competition everything is

becoming hyper competitive there's few

remaining perceived ways to make it by

people right especially young people um

there's diminishing influence of

religion in society this is just an

undebatable fact um and last but not

least all of this is essentially a

crisis of meaning and I believe that all

of the above is bullish crypto it's

especially bullish mcoins and it's

especially bullish cult meme coins last

but not least stories create Trends

right for Trends to emerge there need to

be stories that are percolating across

the industry and the World At Large

about people making large gains in a

particular new category without naming

any names we already seen four or five

of these with Pepe we've seen four or

five of these with Bonk we've seen four

or five of these with whiff this cycle

right and all of the Phantom wallet

screenshots that you see of people

finally making it they don't come from

utility alts they don't come from Tech

alts they come from memes and this is

why momentum is important if you study

past Cycles because of momentum and

reflexivity the things that outperform

in the first half of the cycle are is

the same thing that outperforms in the

second half of the cycle again mem coins

are the outperformance thus far we've

seen this with ethereum it pumped in

2016 it it pumped twice more in 2017

Verge pumped in 2016 pumped twice more

in 2017 uh salana pumped in 2020 pumped

twice more in 2021 you've even seen this

with nfts pumped in 2020 pumped twice

more in 2021 right so this momentum is

important and I believe that the me

Mania quote unquote we had in March of

2024 I think that was just the first of

the three pumps and I think there's two

Giant pumps coming in

2025 um so if you look at the top 20 new

memes it's only 8 billion that just all

of the new memes are still cheaper than

a single VC backed vaporware right so

altcoins are 800 billion unlocks are 155

billion memes overall are 40 billion I

don't think Doge and Sh matter anymore

the new stuff is 8 billion that is

unbelievably cheap and money especially

retail money it naturally wants to pump

something that is easiest to pump and

that is going to be the new memes every

cycle the crypto asset category that

outperforms the most is the one that is

new weird and misunderstood and parabas

are much more likely to occur in assets

that are difficult to Value so not

having a revenue is actually an

advantage with each cycle the main

altcoin narrative is becoming crazier my

theory is that this is is a byproduct of

inflationary pressures on society and

its Collective mental and hormonal

well-being so anxiety essentially pushes

the Swarm further down the risk curve

and you're seeing this with the main

topics that are essentially in Vogue

with each cycle right here's what you

need to understand every single altcoin

out there is actually working on three

products they're working on the software

they're working on the community and

they're working on the token mem coins

are working on two products the

community and the

token people do not need technology or

even a promise of future dividends to

purchase a crypto coin all they need is

to like it and to see people talking

about it any of you who are on crypto

Twitter I'm sure you understand which

topic is being discussed the most right

now on utility a lot of VCS and thought

leaders are gaslighting you into

believing that mem coins don't have any

utility at all I strongly disagree and I

believe that the best mem coins actually

have more utility than almost all Tech

alts what do they offer having fun

loneliness reduction identity hope

provisioning friendships being a part of

Cutting Edge culture sense of belonging

a guild in the mmor RPG that is crypto

experience of teamwork greater sense of

participation they are what Dows were

supposed to be relatability emotional

connection Mission and meaning

entertainment and being happy charity

Collective artistic expression

Collective imagined reality storytelling

and lore building and it's just

hilarious to think about the even the

possibility of getting rich off of memes

so it kind of becomes a reflexive

self-fulfilling prophecy and all of this

is before we discuss the token itself

right so we can debate how much utility

memes have but it's not zero and it

doesn't matter that there's no Revenue

people are paying for these services and

participating by simply buying the token

uh this doesn't all of this logic

doesn't just apply to memec coins the

same logic applies to altcoins as well

but memes do it better because of

structural toonomic and emotional

reasons and here's here's my

controversial opinion altcoins are not

about technology and mcoins are not

about memes what they actually are

they're tokenized communities um they're

tokenized communities that use different

narratives and techniques to recruit

people and get the price to go up and DJ

Spartan has this famous infographic

right whether even if even there's quote

unquote fundamentals it's still

predominantly mimetic in nature I edited

that to display how I see it right so

the actual utility of any altcoin is

probability times magnitude of future

dividends for token holders right we

know most of most most of the time it's

not going to lead to anything but 90% is

still mimetics and speculation for mem

coins it's actually similar there is

some nonzero emotional value but 80 90%

of it is still mimetic and speculative

and what I think is happening in the

industry right now and what you will see

in 2025 is that Meme coins are stealing

the mimetic and uh speculative Premia

away from altcoins right people are

realizing it was never about the tech it

was always about the tokens themselves

so the tokens are just gambling chips

and mem coins are a much better product

they are much purer product which much

greater product Market fit than any Tech

Al so here's what you need to understand

any crypto asset that doesn't distribute

cash flows to your wallet or is a store

of value is a mem coin period so 99.999%

of altcoins were mem coins all along

altcoins are simply meme coins with more

steps it doesn't matter if a token is a

tech token or a meme token so what does

actually

matter the these are the factors that I

believe actually matter to catch the

next outperformer

Community poor people getting rich

perceived maximum upside token

distribution attention fairness organic

prize Discovery eliminating class

Warfare and bitterness within the token

holders no unlocks no Supply overhang

focusing on new coins which can

Enterprise Discovery and avoiding old

coins which have back holders price

action obviously positive momentum

evangelism and Community participation

where can you buy it authenticity holder

growth rates no VCS and VCS having to

buy at Market no cabal and cabal having

to buy at Market who the whales are who

the K's are who's talking about this on

social media obviously the concept and

the meme itself but it's only a small

part of it as you can see the message

decentralization of all kinds cess

people not selling simple uh emotion a

good story it needs to be a good

narrative a freshness of the narrative

you want people to be want to be a part

of that thing that group that movement

right inspiration Trends and cultural

zist outside of crypto

participation stickiness and probably

the most important is what I call free C

labor and notice how not a single one of

these has anything to do with software

Revenue these are the factors that

actually matter you are focused on

technology but the crypto industry is

not a technology first industry it's an

asset first industry even the name of

this conference is token

249 instead of tech you should be

focused on Human Condition retail

motivation and asset distribution mem

coins are here to stay people ask me

there's going to be billions of them I

say that's totally fine

uh 99.999% of them are going to be in

the PVP category AKA hyper gambling you

want to look out for those that want to

be multicycle you want to be out you

want to be uh buying those that are

trying to be the next Doge trying to

build a long-lasting cult trying to be a

brand right and if you ignore the

current crop of hungry Zoomers on crypto

Twitter you will understand that most

retail doesn't actually want to gamble

and constantly rotate they want to buy

and hold something that they resonate

with this is why PVE memes are going to

succeed in the end they want to believe

in something and the word mcoin is a

misnomer it's only about 30% about the

meme itself and it's 70% about the

people again what mequin really are

they're tokenized communities which use

the meme as their symbol and their

banner and there's going to be different

flavors of them so the best PVE memes

are going to be Cults what is a cult

it's a group of people that are

extremely passionate about a cause if

you've been U kind of studying any of

the Silicon Valley blogs from early

2010s you will see many startups always

trying to unbundle Craigslist and at the

risk of being a little bit Blasphemous I

think what you're going to see in the

future is the unbundling of religion it

is uh essentially a Swiss army knife um

where which offers a bunch of products

it offers identity culture Escape

loneliness reduction Community hope and

a bunch of other things and I believe

that religion is losing influence in the

world and Brands experiences and

communities are feeling that void you

can already see that with uh video games

music festivals yoga DMT Retreats

CrossFit Soul cycle keto and obviously

Financial assets right you know how

culty Apple Tesla holders are how

extremely culty Bitcoin holders are and

I believe we're going to be seeing simil

similar phenomena with memes so mem

coins have shared values shared

Lifestyles shared principles and

understand that memes themselves are

only a part of this right and so it

doesn't actually matter if something is

a tech Al or a meme coin what actually

matters is whether it's a cult most

crypto out performance have always been

Cults both Tech and non-tech Bitcoin

ethereum uh Ripple cardano chain link

Dogecoin ship

Tow and a lot of people focus on money

and attention but you also need to focus

on time energy and labor and I don't

think people are going to be putting

their time energy and labor into VC

funded Tech projects that are already at

10 billion because if and if you don't

have Community your token is dead so why

is being a called desirable because

people are not going to be selling

people are going to have very high rates

of particip you're going to have an army

of skidos working for the coin 24/7 even

while you sleep and you're essentially

going to have holders some of which are

Engineers designers and influencers

providing labor for

free so I always like this uh this tweet

by sisifus from April 2024 he said meme

coins are making people realize that

nearly all of the tech in crypto is a

smokees screen designed to sell you a

token that does nothing marked up 100x

from the private round this is why VCS

don't like meme coins it threatens their

Core Business which is selling

Vapor uh just briefly nfts I think meme

coins are going to go much higher

because instead of having 3,000 people

promoting 10,000 illiquid jpegs you now

have 100,000 people promoting one single

liquid token this is how I see the mcoin

space evolving you want to be focused on

things that are going to become Cults

brands or movements um how to Value them

they're not Equity they're not debt

they're not currencies they're not quite

like take alts either the best mem coins

are emerging mini religions and need to

be analyzed as such I see them as

financialized vessels of faith and I see

them as vessels collecting the

satisfaction both within crypto but also

with the word at large so if mem coins

are a financialized middle finger to

crypto movement coins are a

financialized middle finger to the world

and mem coins are simple and Tech Al are

complex retail doesn't want to study

about staking restak or impermanent loss

and they're much more friendly to new

people so putting it all together mem

coins are simpler than Tech alts they're

more liquid than nfts they're safe than

defi they have no inflation no unlocks

they have no UND dumping on you uh you

have better odds than with sports

betting or casinos uh you have more

volatility AKA excitement it's a fresher

narrative it gives retail a chance to

win and the community is much more

passionate than in any other crypto

asset class and the best crypto products

don't require token and the best crypto

tokens don't require product again mcoin

cycle is not a prediction it's already

happening memes are dominating every

metric every single metric so these are

my predictions one trillion for meme

coins uh market cap uh you're going to

see two memes above 100 billion you're

going to see 10 memes above 10 billion a

quarter of the first page of coin market

cap is going to be memes 10% meme coin

dominance utility and VC backed alts

will continue out underperforming fat

protocol thesis will slowly die because

building store value and casino number

four number five is getting increasingly

hard VCS will be buying Blue Chip meme

coins Smart Ones are already beginning

to do so trafy will be buying meme coins

Smart Ones are already beginning to do

so and you will see hyper mecoin before

hyperbitcoinization and a lot of people

talking about economics of belief

tokenization of faith and financialized

new religions uh for more insights

follow me on Twitter at must mad and

remember stop trading and believe in

something thank you
