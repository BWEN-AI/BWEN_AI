you're not that bullish on the animals and I think the reason why you're not so bullish on the animals is because once you get to the further Point yeah cute

you know blah blah blah people buy pop pop pop pop but then there's not enough deeper meaning to make it a religious

thing that's stable is that right yeah exactly and one of my theories is that we are going to see a gradual transition

from animals to non-an animals uh and the reason for that is because a lot of the non-animal stuff for example like

Giga and SPX are my top two biggest positions to me personally as well as what I'm seeing in their respective

communities they inspire people and they motivate people much more than just funny animal pictures the funny animal

pictures they are an echo of Doge and ship from last cycle right this is a

more of a 50 to 100 IQ play where people are like okay like dogs work last time

let's create dogs again or let's create cats but the ones I'm promoting they're trying to be something like next stage

like the the future right and you always want to be you always want to be skating where the puck is

[Music]

[Music] going welcome everybody episode 64 of

## Intros w/ Murad

steady Lads I am particularly excited excited to uh to have Morad with us

today um everyone who's on crypto Twitter has probably realize that we

have a new Overlord a new main character I think uh I've heard a lot of names mad

I've heard you're the Michael sailor of memes I've heard you the meme coin Jesus which which seems appropriate as well um

are are you kind of like comfortable with like being the main character there's always the the saying of like

you know try to avoid it but how do you feel yeah so the recent inflow of sort

of attention followers Etc is definitely bigger than what I expected like 8 to 12

weeks ago um nevertheless I'm just doing my best and encouraging all my friends

as well um to kind of remain stoic and remain patient uh and humble uh because

I think unnecessary Euphoria or unnecessary celebrations um there's just

way too early for that um in my personal opinion I'm leaning towards sort of this

bull market and specifically the M Mania to still last anywhere between like8 to

14 months and so I'm not going to be celebrating anything until like early

2026 and so um just encouraging everybody and myself trying as well to just like be very locked in for 2025

yeah I mean you know I'm in a bunch of telegram chats obviously everyone's like talking about your thesis you've gone out there um we were talking you know

pre-show that we're going to try to bring up different topics and you've already covered but I saw anom today on

the timeline he is very supportive uh even in the telegram chats you know he

he likes what you're talking about um we have this tweet from balle on IAS here

kind of encapsulating that even though you know we we have someone saying like

we got to stop relying on ansoms and make our own decisions anom Army just joins mad's

cult um he he's saying like you're the you know you're the guy like I don't

know I feel like you have a very style than him so it's it's quite different even though he's been talking about meme

coins um would you say like there's a there's a a large difference or how do you see how anom has been doing for the

last year versus kind of your more thesa striven style especially as of the last

six months I try to trade and rotate on time uh much less and just my goal is to

hold uh until at least uh the Q4 of 2025 um that being said I met Anam in

Singapore uh through weeks ago and he seemed very down toe so I'm personally a

fan um I think there's going to be a bunch of different sort of main characters or mini main characters like in the next 18 months um and I think we

all just have our uh separate roles to play in the mcoin Super Cycle yeah so

## How Did Murad Get To This Point?

you know when I first heard about you Mor I think you were on like Pal's podcast in 2018 2019 talking about

Bitcoin and then I think you know you ran a fund you created like a defi project and now you've just fully

embraced the speculative Mania that is crypto and now you're like full full on like bullish meme coins like how did

that like transition like how how did you get here you know just we can talk about yeah for sure I guess I can start

a little bit earlier um while I was a student in the United States I did a year abroad in China that was 2013 2014

so during that sort of the famous 2013 Bitcoin bubble um was kind of lucky to be in the right place at the right time

had a couple of American friends that were in Beijing like doing different like early BTC stuff so that's how I got

my early exposure uh two little break uh 2016 uh realized with the whole sort of ethereum wave 2017 in particular that I

just needed to uh do sort of crypto full-time uh 2015 2016 I was working at

Commodities trading and also briefly in trafi but once sort of BTC did very well in 2017 I um just decided to do crypto

full-time and ever since then like you said I've been doing a bunch of different things sort of uh writing um

investing trading um Angel Investing um did had a fund in 2019 19 2020

unfortunately that didn't go so well but uh we're back now sort of grinding hustling uh the key is to always uh

stand stand back up whenever you fall down so here we are are you running it as a fund or is it just your own PA or

like how how is it now because you're saying running it back is it still similar structure like yeah uh as of

right now I'm only managing my own money okay I mean I heard that you guys were doing a lot of good trades obviously

like there was some crazy volatility That Shook a lot of people out uh on in March uh 2020 but I heard from some of

your like investors that you guys were doing a lot of good stuff as well like it seemed like uh how did you feel about

you know were you learning or you still kind of like learning learning about risk management or about the craziness

of crypto or like how would you reflect on that period so we were actually outperforming uh BTC which was kind of

like our uh the thing like that we were trying to outperform um literally up until like a week or or 10 days before

sort of the the covid events right um yeah we were up 60% at one point even

though BTC was down which is like relatively difficult to do uh unfortunately my sort of long position

size was a little bit too big in the two three days leading up to the covid crash so um definitely a lot of lessons

learned from that um my strategy for this cycle uh and probably until the

rest of my life to be honest is to be predominantly focused on like low leverage or in this case right now like

leverage at all uh I'm just focused on holding spot assets that I think will do best in 2025 and Frankly Speaking um it's a much

better lifestyle uh like emotionally and and and stress wise well the good thing

about meme coings is that the amount of volatility is so high that you don't need leverage you're already getting the

VA you know 200 that you want without it yeah for sure and I wanted to ask you

about the project that you were working on before sort of this pivot uh to investing mostly in the beam coin space

um maybe you could share a little bit about the Journey of trying to find product Market fit how difficult that is and if that actually brought you to

where you are today for context I'm working on a project it's extremely hard to build things people want right and I

think something that comes out of that as a builder is this sort of cynicism towards this space that you have to push back against and I'm curious if like

that cynicism Led You To Your Meme coin thesis uh actually I'm still working on that project um and I'm going to

continue to uh for the next uh 2 3 years or however long it takes uh but uh yeah

the project is called stfx uh it is kind of like defi social fi um we originally

started on arbitrum uh you could essentially instead of having volts dedicated to portfolios you you could have volts dedicated to single trades um

and yeah we had we had over 2,000 users like in general and right now I believe

we have like 250 active users uh but what we're right now is we're moving to salana uh which I think is going to be

is going to be playing a much more major role specifically in the context of mcoins and active trading in 2025

especially compared to arbitrum um and yeah right now we're essentially finalizing our salana integration uh

hopefully should be launching late October early November I've heard a strategy from a lot of Founders it's

like you know you can't quite get everything right and you move to salana it's like the meme where the guy just

like patches like move to salana just like

filter the save everything um yeah exactly I mean that's uh it depends on

the nature of the product right I I I guess a lot of the times just moving to salana is it's kind of a meme at this

point I totally agree in our case though we are building sort of these speculative vaults that are dedicated to active trading and I mean active trading

whether you like it or not it has shifted from the ethereum ecosystem to salana this cycle so I think in our specific case uh the ship kind of like

## Doxxed By ZachXBT

is much more reasonable and I think earlier you're talking about managing big positions and speaking of that uh I

think this morning there was a lot of drama on CT where you know Zack xbt decided to dox your wallets um so it

seems like anom right and like the crypto Deens their supportive abuse I go my God like what is Zach doing uh how

did you feel when you saw this and like are these these your wallets um so yes

those are my wallets um there's no point in hiding that um the Frank truth is

that if you've been deep in the Discord and telegram trenches with other onchain

Warriors and hardcore onchain [ __ ] then they've already had those wallets uh for the past five six months um in fact I

believe this doc sing is bullish because people can check every single wallet for themselves and notice that I haven't

sold a single meme coin pretty much ever yeah you're Diamond handed I definitely

saw like the argument where yeah like this actually locks supply for these coins therefore it's bullish but like

when I mean at some point you have to sell right um you mentioned like the 8 to 14 month Target but like what would

need to happen in order for your thesis to be invalidated or for you to like just start skimming profits yeah just for the sake of

transparency I mean I try to be as honest as I can with everything I do um I'm probably going to take some profits

in Q4 of 2025 I'll be very public and transparent about that on a bunch of different podcasts and videos um but

until then uh my goal is to just d in hand all of my positions are you worried about like a Cascade of people selling

when they see that in 2025 you do sell or do you feel like they'll be such a a Mania like with centralized exchange

listings and you you can just kind of do it or um I'm not concerned about that at

the moment uh I don't plan to sell any of my positions for at least another year or at least that's what I'm aiming

to do and um yeah like I said it's bullish because I'm not the kind of

person who uh is going to sell for like a 5x 10x 20x or whatever um I genuinely

believe in all of the thesis just a just 20x or whatever you know just a just a

pleb pleb 20x right right well I genuinely believe in all of the targets and thesis that

I've outlined and the only thing that this doxing proves is that I practice what I preach so do you have any

concerns over the responsibility you now have in the space where like tokens that you talk about are now like how they

perform is directly correlated to to what you say on Twitter and it public places like a token 2049 how has that

impacted you you know like I said I I've given very clear uh entry points very

clear targets uh both in terms of price and time uh very clear amounts that I

own and like the timing associated with all of these things so I I don't know what else I can do to be even more

transparent now uh pretty much everybody has most of my wallets so um yeah

there's definitely a responsibility here with the recent flux of followers but um

like I said I I believe in most of my targets I think um seven or eight of them will definitely hit uh maybe some

will disappoint I actually think some of them will overshoot my targets right um and I'm very much aware that a lot of CT

uh especially in the past couple of weeks maybe a little bit less so today but u a lot the majority of CT still thinks that my targets are delusional

and crazy but I wouldn't want in any other way because if everybody agreed with me today then that means that

there's like little up side left like I don't want this to be consensus and the way I see it is uh 5 to six months from

now people will be giving targets that are even higher than mine so um the way I see it everything is unfolding exactly

as it's supposed to be unfolding uh the way I have predicted so far and like I said I think it's going to continue for another seven to 12 months let's take

one of these tokens though that has been maybe the most successful since you started talking about it this is a token

that uh has been around a long time didn't really have much going on then it's just completely exploded so we're

talking about uh S&P 6900 which is like the intention to flip the S&P 500 in in

like market cap like this kind of meme um obviously it's done super well maybe we can get the chart just actually I

would rather you not pull the chart because uh in the SP SPX in the SPX Community uh it's taboo to be uh posting

charts so one of our sort of slogans and motos is there is no chart uh because we

believe chart We Believe here's the thing right and I I'll delve into that a little bit later

but if you guys have seen my presentation I draw a parallel between meme coins and sort of Neo religions I

know it sounds crazy and I understand that it sounds a little bit Blasphemous uh that being said I think um

essentially uh there is a void that the disintegration of religion since the 1950s is leaving in kind of people's

hearts and different things uh Brands experiences and communities and by the

way I don't think of meme coins as like memes I think of them as tokenized communities first and foremost these things are not fully but partially um

replacing the product Market fit that religion has lost in the west right and

um in this way essentially the way you need to see it is it's Darwinism it's group Darwinism and our idea is that um

organizations with a token are going to outperform organizations without a token because the financial incentives are

obviously turbo charged I'm sure you guys understand this this and one of our beliefs is that uh too much chart

watching too much price watching too much chain watching and wallet watching is negative for the journey because um

it creates sort of a local unnecessary spikes in your dopamine uh when instead

you should be trying to be as stoic as possible for as long as possible right that being said I can definitely discuss

SPX 6900 and my thesis for it this is the mcoin I'm most bullish on uh my

public Target is a 100 billion and I believe that that is very conservative actually I think it can even overshoot

that Target uh now the reason I'm so bullish on it is because it's already transcended the status of a meme coin

and it's already transcended the status of a cult it's something much bigger and I think it's going to go viral on

Instagram Tik Tok Reddit 4 Chan YouTube and everything in between uh what it is is it's a movement it's a financial

movement and the way I see mcoins in general and this one specifically does it very well um they are vessels of

faith and they are vessels of dissatisfaction they're vessels of dissatisfaction not only with the crypto

World which is how they started uh this cycle but also with the World At Large

and the way we can go into like my Quant metrics my metrics of decentralization

my metric s distribution but at the end of the day it's about the people and it's about emotion and at the end of the

day the math behind m coins is just a mirror to the emotional side of it and at the end of the day in order to find

the biggest outperformers that will grow to be the biggest mean coins it boils down to what I describe as inspiration

per capita right because the more inspiration per capita you're going to have in a certain mcoin the more free

cult labor you're going to trigger in an average participant and what that means is a lot of the participants in these

meme coins the holders both uh big holders and small holders and everyone in between they are like Engineers

designers influencers in real life right and what they would usually charge 51

$15,000 uh in their real job in their real life to do they do these things for free right so your job as a mcoin quote

unquote investor is to find the the communities the movements which trigger as much uh free C labor per capita as

possible and that's how you sort of have these insane Network effects I have a like two very important questions like

one obviously you know things taken off now so you know the rocket started okay

do you think that um it would have done it without your attention on it because obviously you have been very public on

this specific one that is your favorite one and and you know you've you've kind of made people aware of it and and maybe

you're right that like if you had made people aware of something else you know it wouldn't have resonated and like so

maybe like there's some factor of you and some factor of it did resonate you know it's kind of both do you think if

you hadn't talked about it like this would inevitably still be the best cult Meme and it would have taken off anyway because it's it's I'm I'm like not sure

if that's the case or I believe it genuinely would and the reason for that is because um I made a

list of 30 things that are most important in a quote unquote cult and it ticked off 29 of them better than

everyone else and the only one thing it was missing is kind of a little just a small spark of attention right uh just a

small spark of any one large crypto Twitter account talking about it and if

it wasn't me it would have been another large account one month from now or two months from now so it it's not because

of me uh I simply accelerate it the way I see it is the guys in the community

that have already been grinding and hustling and creating media and creating War for a year they loaded a tub of

gunpowder and I simply was the final spark now uh to be practical I think the answer is like a mix of both what you

said and what I said um there's definitely like components to it but the way I see it I'm only 20 20 25% of it in

in the long term right uh you saw me you saw me call nine other coins but they

haven't done that well the reason why this one is doing that well is not just

because I called it but because it's generally like a very inspiring and crazy idea and what I did was I shined a

little bit of light on it and now smart people both retail and institutional are

looking at it and being like this is much cooler than any animal coin this is the next Evolution this is the next step

where instead of tokenizing animal pictures and cute cats we're now tokenizing these ideas right and it's

much it's much more inspiring and it's much more sort of passion triggering right you could say that like previous

neem coins like Dogecoin or whatever we also sort of this anti-wall street kind of movement thing but this one

encapsulated in the actual name and and so it's much more direct but one followup and we'll go to Justin do you

see yourself as like because you you also talk about like as like as if you're part of the cult where you're

like oh we don't in our community we don't we don't show the charts in our community but but you know at the same

time I hear you being a very rational investor and you're more like you know I'm making a bet on what's going to

happen I'm not like going to get into the religion as a fanatic myself are you kind of both or are you trying to put

yourself in so that you can really know what it's like and you want to stay there as well how do you see it so what

I'm my my whole thesis is that these two roles are merging you understand these are these two roles that you've just

described between an investor and a Believer and a participant essentially everybody in the world is becoming an

activist investor as far as Mee quins are concerned right so the game theory um no pun intended is it to essentially

do a little bit of all of these things you understand uh to create memes to create media to spread the message to

obviously like Buy in DCA um and to also like be an investor but also be the

## The Memecoin Movement

participant in the culture right I I want to ask Brad I mean it maybe pushed back a little how in your view is this a

movement I mean is the response we're seeing in the community we're seeing not merely just a response to number going

up and I guess I would follow on to that is like is there still a movement of insiders and early buyers decide to sell

and it goes down 95% like is there still something there because to me like this

is just a negative sum game where the vast vast majority of people end up losing money and a small percentage of

insiders and early adopters make money and the second that those people make money by selling into the market and

people end up losing money this movement you call it or this community dies as we've seen happen you know hundreds or

thousands of times before what would be your answer to that do you think going to church is negative sum for for the

individual person I don't think that's a fair comparable I mean this is just a a

speculative bet people are buying right if you were to invest in a church token and then you went to church because you

own the token like maybe we could compare the two but I I don't but that's exactly but but that's exactly what it

is these things are um these things are essentially Church replacers with a financialized layer on top so there's a

little bit of both of these things uh to answer your first question the reason why SPX 6900 is doing particularly well

is precisely because nobody's selling right and the reason they're not selling is because they know the people that

have bought into the idea they know that this is going to like 50 billion 100 billion and some members of the

community even think it's going to like 400 billion five maybe even a trillion who knows like I know this sounds crazy

but that's it doesn't matter because that's what the community believes right and um the the Diamond handing the the

aggregate levels of diamond handing are a function of collective belief in like future upside right now the reason why I

particularly like this one and a couple of others as well is because I think uh this one has a higher chance than others

of being a multicycle coin just like Doge was and my thesis is that sure

99.999% of m coins are going to go to zero or whatever at the end of the cycle but I think three or four of them are

going to end up being multicycle they're going to make higher lows and then higher highs four or five years from now

again so maybe you could just answer I guess the core part of my question is why is this not a zero sum or negative

sum game the only way you can make money is if someone buys and people lose money when you sell that's a great question so

first things first right um let's discuss the non- token aspect of it if

you look at the non-token aspect of it and you agree even even partially with my thesis that these are actually and by

the way I have the exact same thesis for altcoins by the way right so my thesis is that altcoins are actually not about

tech and meme coins are actually not about memes what I think they both are

um I think they're both tokenized communities with a financialized layer on top and then they essentially use

like different techniques and narratives to get people to like join their cause whatever that may be right and even if

we ignore the money aspect of it for a second um I don't know if you've spent any times in like the group chats or the

discords or whatever but if you are an active Community member of these things right I actually think they so the

correct way to model them financially is you know in Silicon Valley there is like B2B platforms and then there's b2c

platforms what mcoins actually are at least the best ones they are ctoc platforms does that make sense they're

ctoc platforms so there's emerging value being created uh by you um finding

friends reducing your loneliness finding some kind of a meaning finding entertainment a lot of these do charity

together a lot of these do Universe building together like a metaverse early metaverse type thing a lot of these

essentially there are guilds in the MMO RPG that is crypto you're essentially finding friends and to you it might seem

subjectively valueless but I know for a fact that there are thousands of no

hundreds of thousands of people in these communities who find a tremendous amount of value right and technically speaking

if there's even a single person that is going to buy these tokens and they're never going to sell them then that

technically means it's not Zero Sum right now we can definitely reach a point in 2025 2026 when these things are

like overvalued undervalued whatever but my whole thesis is that their value is not zero and I think this is not priced

in I think in Q2 Q3 of next year you're going to have like VCS and smart people

and prop funds come up with valuation formulas come up with ways to kind of figure out whether they're locally or

globally underbed overal whatever there's going to be a lot of quants like trying to figure out theories formulas Etc right but essentially what we're

doing we're combining Finance culture and communities into this one thing uh whether you personally like it or not

doesn't matter the fact of the matter is there is demand for these things and that's all that matters and just one last question before I pass it back to

Jordy and tie uh marad I'm curious like is there still a community if these

things don't go up do people still stick around or is the community built out of number go up that's EX exactly how you

identify the best ones uh you want to identify those where the price is at like a negative 70 75% dip but the

community is sort of vibing hanging out hanging in spaces creating media creating videos creating memes uh with

greater intensity than ever before right so the less Community cares about price and the more Community cares about

culture genuinely right the better the coin and that's actually how I made most

of my picks on my list uh I essentially want coins that are at least 6 months old I want um I want a bunch of 70% dips

because those are essentially like uh create battle Harden communities those are essentially exams right and I want

um the supply to leave like Trader types and I want the supply to go into believer hands and that's exactly how

you get these crazy moves uh and the kind of move that you've seen over the past two or three weeks you're going to be seeing a lot of them in 2025 let's

try to play The Devil's Advocate on on the targets because the targets like you said a lot of people people think it's

crazy you know I think I think so too so um one of the things I want to push back on is just the numbers that we're

talking about so I understand like the religious aspect and you want to find the communities that are you know so

religious or so you know [ __ ] like you can kind of call it whatever you want to call it but like numbers going

up and there just like no like it doesn't matter I don't care I'm cool but you know 100 billion means that you've

gone through 10 billion and you've gone through 20 and and 50 and there's people who own you know % like you seem to you

publicly said you have uh 2.8% of like this token let's say um I I

get the religious aspect but you you think like you wake up one day and you look at your your phone and you look at

your portfolio and and you got bunch of tokens that are worth you know $1,000 $2,000 and then like there's the there's

this one and it says like 2 billion 158 milon

326,000 and and you know are are are you are you just chilling

like are you just kind of like okay I trust everybody else like 3 three like this kind of Olympus Dow thing like U

maybe ta you have this picture of uh you know last cycle me and ta did did a whole thing on Olympus and and that was

bringing this like religious aspect and of course that Community I was in that Discord and like watching they were you

know very passionate and very fervent um religious but to get to the numbers

you're talking about people really have to to just completely trust everybody

else and ignore their you know there's so much money to be taken in the liquidity pools right well there's that

aspect but on the other side of the formula there's also how much Global demand there's going to be for this thing right obviously like in this cycle

## Retail & Memecoins

we haven't seen much retail come in so I I guess like your your belief is that that's gonna it's gonna completely change the retail is going to entirely

be investing into mean coins uh it's already happening um I'm talking closely

to a bunch of apps like moonshot and and bags and a couple of other ones um

that I'm aware of that essentially m coins are dominating retail attention already and I still think we're in the

early stages of this um there is literally zero reason for retail to be

buying anything other than memes right now like if you look at this uh the quote unquote good uh Tech projects are

launching at 1015 billion valuations I mean we've already went through two or three altcoin Cycles retail understands

that the upside on if you launch starkware launches at 20 billion like the up your upside is not great though

you know what I mean and um even if retail are BTC believers they know that the 2x 3x that they have left like quote

unquote this cycle locally is probably not going to change their life so what I actually think uh retail is going to do

game theoretically speaking again um a bunch of them are just going to hyper gamble but some of them are going to

like Buy and Hold and you want to be buying the coins that you think they they are most likely to buy and hold and

that's how you get uh the best risk reward micor Investments does that make sense but the number is still I mean uh

we had gme and uh gme was this phenomenon there's Netflix documentaries you know everyone on the news was

talking about it and even for that coin that was getting short squeezed because

you know it wasn't just retail like there were hedge funds stuck and they had to get out um I mean at at so right

now we're at 20 it looks like it you know tempor rally just kind of went to like 100 bit over 100 um what's what's

the market cap here uh Justin can you can you find the covered market cap that we can just maybe multiply it by six or

something so the market cap is 9.2 billion right now okay so it kind of like briefly let's say spike to 60 and

and this is like the one that was the the global phenomenon does does that put in any perspective or or you or you

still think like this is going to be much stronger than even a gme was it it has potential to be bigger because it's

decentralized and you can't print new shares which gme has been doing a lot recently so um I think I think it can go

much higher than that and um the global access to crypto stuff is just much more

uh widely distributed than stocks and and just so the audience is aware too the predictions you gave at token 2049 1

trillion mcoin market cap currently 40 billion so the crypto market caps about 2 trillion right now so this is a

massive increase in crypto and then also obviously memec coins 2 meme coins over 100 billion 10 over 10 billion and about

25% of the top 100 coins are mem coins with 10% mem coin dominance yeah I mean

the entirety the entirety of the first page of coin market cap Is MeMe coins already but we can get that as well fair

enough yeah and I feel like the the arguments that you pose um I mean I you

know I think everyone's listening to your talk it's it's really convincing I think there's a lot of thing I re one

thing I realized in the past year is that there's a lot of populism in crypto where it's like I hate the rich people I hate the VCS um and I think that's why

aird drop farming was a really big narrative you know like let's say eight to 12 months ago because it gave the

power to retail that could Farm these things um and now it's like no longer the case um but if you Justin if you can

share my screen uh I think the financial analism argument makes sense um and

there's a lot of people that are defending you for example Co trer with like the whole Zack xbt thing um but

then hus uh kind of give this argument that you know this whole reductionist argument is just a way for people to

just shill like you know mem coins and like you know scam coins to each other um and people are calling you grifters

so like how would you you know push back against that argument that you know you actually believe in this stuff and that

you're not just like trying to pump things so you and your friends can just make a bunch of money yeah I mean uh

hustling is yet to see the proper mtic light uh because from what I understand from his uh Twitter page he uh

predominantly focuses on like centralized exchange perpetrating of majors and those guys are usually the

slowest to kind of buy into the M Corin narrative and I've been discussing this with a bunch of different demographics

um but ultimately the way I see it is all of the altcoins in crypto or at least the

absolute vast majority of them since 2013 have always been meme coins and at

the very least um every single asset from Tesla down to the shittiest animal

coin uh they have a memetic component to some extent to some extent right maybe

for government bonds it's 5% uh and for animal coins it's 99% but there are

certain sort of factors and certain Premia that you can sort of uh put together uh for different asset classes

and my thesis is that look even if meme coins are 90% speculative that that was

still the exact same case with altcoins right so there's no moral High Ground for altcoin people and you know a lot of

these altcoins are literally making1 to $2,000 per day in Revenue but they're

trading at1 billion valuations obviously that valuation doesn't come from like a DCF you know that valuation comes from

some kind of like a narrative memetic type uh valuation right and uh meem

coins are powerful because they're actually letting retail participants uh become wealthy

for the first time in 2017 right and I actually think just calling it all uh

Financial nihilism or degeneracy or brain Rod or whatever doesn't do it justice right it doesn't do it justice

because that's like handwave a lot of people who uh have not made any money from mem coins frankly they're hand

waving all these things and they're trying to essentially like [ __ ] on memes uh but my view is that they combin the

best parts of nfds they combine the best parts of icos with the local and cheap price Discovery they combine the best

parts of Dao with the decentralized labor that I mentioned and they get rid of all of the unnecessary waer Weare

that we're seeing like all the fake performance are [ __ ] right and people especially young people in their

20s and 30s are really resonating with this message so whether whatever hustling thinks it doesn't matter uh

because at the end of the day uh there's demand for these things and um like if

if he trading altcoins then he's trading mean coins too right so there's there's nothing special about this yeah I

listeners of listeners of our show um will have heard me talk for for weeks

and months now about you know there's the product and there's the token and they're two separate things and when I

heard you say it I'm like yes this is exactly what I've been talking about for for a long time now and and you put it so clearly um there were a lot of things

in your in your speech uh that you gave that were spot on and I think um are a

lot of the reasons why why things are going um in the direction where you're saying like yeah all the front page is

mem coins and there is a lot of um discontent so our audience is generally

like very Crypton native you know they're all uh in the weeds a lot of whales uh a lot of people kind of

full-time in the space so let's kind of like dig into some of the more detailed things because I think the general thesis they've heard it and there's a

lot of aspects that we like um you know things things to push back uh one is

like and this is the one that people tell me the most often that they disagree with you on um yes altcoins are

Insider games and BCS and like all this market like all this stuff is going on

basically every single meme coin also has either like snipers or has insiders

cabals that own most of it control the supply try to get listed on centralized exchanges because that's you know when

you're on binance it's a different uh amount of users that you can reach out to um is it not still the same game like

I guess Iceberg here is kind of yeah I mean you can actually you can actually study um to what extent uh something is

sniped to what extent something is bundled how well distributed it is how organically distributed it is how like

fake distributed it is you can do all of that on chain um I'm not going to bore you with the details uh because that's

what I kind of spend a lot of my hours doing dayto day but you can you can see what's going on like you can look into

the early blocks you can notice the bundles you can notice the Snipes and then you can see if the sniper is still holding if the sniper has sold um that

is actually precisely why I have a huge bias for coins that are at least seven eight months old because um you can fake

a lot of things like the cabal can fake volume they can fake exchange listings they can fake marketing but the one

thing they can't fake is time and um the best case scenarios that I've noticed

thus far is you find a community which has a very unique concept it's and

you want it to have been traded trading under 20 million under 30 million for

about a year or at least for about six months usually in those cases you have

what's called a wealth transfer from early like speculators and like short-termist people to like long-term

Believers and that's how you kind of find these best coins now um all of the

concerns you raised are very much true and the one thing that I've actually been privately advising uh some of the

smarter VCS that are starting to look at memes uh some of the institutional investors and just wealthy whales that

want to dip their toes into memes is the following hire a Quant or an onchain

sleuth to um figure out how bundled something is how truly and genuinely

decentralized it is because I don't want to name any names I don't want to step on anyone's toes but these meme coins

the gap between them and the gap between their fairness and decentralization and authenticity is absolutely huge I mean I

think we all saw like there was like book of meme or something day one and then it's like on binance and everywhere

else and you're like what kind of Kabal [ __ ] is going on here like there's clearly like some that you know are

there's something going on it's very clear like it's not organic uh like like I said I don't want to name any names

but I will agree with you that if a meme coin is one day old and within 24 hours

it gets listings on every T1 T2 exchange uh there's obviously some fishy [ __ ] going on you know what I mean so um in

the it it's organic when the listings happen six months in and they're gradual

from t3s to t2s to t1s that's how organic meme coins and by the way um I

just need to sort of push back on something you said a couple of episodes ago um you pointed to popcat and for

some reason you called it a cabal coin when everybody who's like done deep analysis of all these coins you will

know that pop chat is the most decentralized one right they don't have a team uh they have the most

decentralized like wallet distributions across like whales mini whales upper

middle class middle class holders uh they have some of the fastest growing retail holder growth and just like no

matter how you look at it they don't even have a treasury all right uh no matter how you look at it it is the

single most decentralized catcoin right so there are cat again I'm not going to mention any names but there are cat

coins that are hardcore cabal and the supply is literally concentrated in the hands of like seven eight people but

## Memecoins vs NFTs

popcat is not one of them okay I mean I'll say like you know I'm not an expert on mcoin distributions and a lot of it

is sort of you know information that gets told to me I was told popcat has some you know big popcat whales but

maybe you're right it's it's the most decentralized I I can't speak to it um what I can speak to is though like a

couple things so um I I I I want to like dive into like some of the details here

like one you're saying these things bring out the best of nfts and yes like

it's more liquid than nfts um one thing that's really not similar to nfts when

you have a a collection people who have one uh even if it's a legendary one and

somebody else just like a normal one there is a sense of equality like we're all kind of sort of equal like we all

have one pudgy one ape whatever one Punk even if you know one's a bit rarer or

whatever with mean coins like you got people with you know 5% of the supply and you got people with like

0.005% um that doesn't really improve the inequality that the that this

movement is is sort of against does it uh it's actually the other way around

and I'll tell you why I believe that with nfts and especially for example with successful nft collections what

ends up happening and if you study 2021 what ends up happening is you have uh 3 and a half thousand holders uh

effectively evangelizing 10,000 IL liquid jpex but what you have with mean

coins is you're going to end up having 500,000 holders all evangelizing a single coin and actually with nfts um

with the with the expensive floor price they become prohibitively expensive to lowincome users or low-income investors

but with mean coins uh lowincome people can still participate precisely Because

the actual financial asset is much more liquid and because it's fungible so

actually mean coins are much more um sort of like friendly to all income

classes and they're actually much more populist and equal than nfts are and they're much more scalable globally as

well right but the community members like one of them is gonna make you know a million dollars One's Gonna Make

right10 like One's Gonna Make 50 million it's not going to be the same as like oh you know the floor went up or something

right right that being said though compar to so the way in terms of price discovery which is what you're

referencing uh mean coins are more some icos and if you look at 2017 um you had

retail have an opportunity to buy Chain Lake I think at like 20 million market cap they had an opportunity to buy

binance uh binance coin at like 25 million right you know full well that

these kinds of opportunities are no longer available in the tech coins or at least very rarely occasionally you get

something now but uh for the vast majority of these things the the gains

are happening in the private rounds like in the shadows right and what mean coins are at least allowing yeah obviously

somebody's going to buy cheaper somebody's going to buy later but at least the price Discovery is more fair

and you don't have launches starting at 15 billion in most cases a lot of them range in like five million 10 million

category before they make the big move which I think compare at least compared to the VCB Tech coins is much more fair

but you know we talked about distribution and I'm kind of a believer that distribution is undervalue like people

don't realize how much distribution matters and even with Bitcoin I mean you've kind of been uh in Bitcoin even

longer than me I think we were like 15 years in and we're still you know

occasionally seeing some super centralized you know big holder that you

know just suddenly like dumps a billion dollars because so even 15 years in the

the distribution is not great I mean ethereum has it all the time it constantly seeing like you know massive

wallets that wake up Suddenly and like you are kind of crushing that price and that's many years in do you really think

that like you know because you said six to eight months you know it's good enough six eight months is that really

enough time to distribute coins where um you know someone's not gonna just wake

up one day and and take a you know 20 million profit and destroy it the the

process of all BTC and mcoin discussion are separate but I'm going to answer it from the BTC angle right now uh you

can't have a monetization of a Neo gold happen without inequality just capitalism and free markets just don't

work like that whether you like it or not some people are going to hold more and some people are going to hold less like if it's a free market it's

impossible to manage it any other way right like how else would you do it uh otherwise it just would be like straight

communism right uh now that being said I believe BTC is going to be much more distributed like 203 years from now and

uh by the time it becomes essentially the def facto Global based money um it's

by that time it's going to become much more distributed than it is today um like I said this is the only way to sort

of accept that upside volatility it's impossible like that PR monetization is impossible without inequality so there's

nothing there's literally nothing you can do but accept it now as I'm sure you know there have been many attempts in

2014 2015 to like create coins that like give people equal Supply or they kind of

redistribute the coins or whatever but that's just socialism on chain that's not how reality I'm not talking about equal toly I'm just saying that

if you have it's this long process like you said it's going to take 20 30 years and if you only have six months there's

still going to be so many people with you know 5% 3% 4% and like it just

becomes a hindrance to the to the growth because every time it starts to go up somebody will hit their profit Target

and like take it and sort of like you end up just uh bouncing bouncing off of those people and the only way Bitcoin is

going to really like blow up we're still waiting it's got It's got these whales selling at 70k for for months now we

just need those coins to get distributed right isn't that the way forward like for for Bitcoin let's say so same for

any coin right right well yes but you will also agree that the distribution of

wealth and income in the traditional Financial system is also quite unequal right and that's and that's with the

traditional Financial system having a 400y year Head Start so Bitcoin is only 15 years old and inequality in in sort

of holders is it's totally natural it's totally natural and with time and you've already seen this right with with time

the distribution and equality will get better I I have a question um and Justin if you can share my screen I think

there's been a lot of discussions around I guess ethics and morality um an did

this poll um is talking about m coins and low Cap B chain coins grifting 56% said yes 46 or 44% said no um so I think

you know you kind of mentioned earlier where they do with Hustlin um he just trades on centralized exchanges he doesn't get it um do you think that the

people that call mem coin I guess influencers K's uh like that talk about

it is it is it just cope because they don't own it so they're like just kind of justifying to themselves that okay so

can you expand on like the whole the whole cope argument yeah it is of course it's it's cope and the cope comes from

the fact that Meme coiners are making massive amounts of wealth with relatively little effort while the sex

uh centralized exchange perpetrators are leading insanely stressful lives trying to catch like local rotations uh in the

price right and so people are very angry that Meme coiners are uh becoming

wealthy with relatively low effort while they have to grind it out for 2% here 3%

there the other thing is I actually think his view is a little bit elitist because um he can afford to be a large

centralized exchange Trader like he can afford to be a large calized exchange whale but a lot of people in mean coins

uh they come from like middle class lower middle class or even lower class backgrounds and they're just looking for a way to make it right so even if you

take the hyper nihilistic view that this is PVP which is not my way of looking at it um they are still purer and fairer

than altcoins I I just have to push back I mean you say everyone's or a lot of people are making so much money on Meme

coins but we know that most people that in invest or purchase meme coins lose money don't you think that's like a

little unfair to say that everyone in the meme coin space is making so much and okay but how is that different from

Forex Trading where 88% of people lose money as well totally I'm not saying it's any different better or worse but I

think to describe meme coins as this new paradigm where everyone's getting rich as a community together is a little bit

well it's not and I'm well it's not a new paradigm but at least from the asset perspective it's a much fairer and more

transparent game than what goes on with VCB coins and nobody can debate that

yeah I guess it's kind of hard to argue like the whole you know if people are making money and what not because um

when I was collecting questions on Twitter for this podcast I think one person said uh it's not grifting if the

coin goes up right because then we're actually making money uh so it's kind of based it's kind of past dependent it's

grifting if it goes down but it's positive sum if it pumps uh so I guess

you know people have to rely on your analysis that you know the 10 coins you talked about is PVE and it becomes like

a Neo religion uh so here's here's the thing right it's not a black white thing

it's a spectrum um but I try to like I try to tell people that like the way to

make it is to hold uh the way to make like I every single day I discourage people from Trading rotating timing new

launches scalping uh because I genuinely believe that your probability uh of

success goes from like 5% to 40 50% if

you sort of focus on the PVE aspect of it if you focus on the community building aspect of it now of course

there's going to be winners and losers but that's it's the exact same way in every Financial market and every crypto asset class I wanted to ask uh just a

## Speculation First, Tech Second

question like saying given let's assume everything you're saying is true like how do you actually feel about it like

is you know you have this great part in your presentation where we say we live in a you say we live in a speculation

first industry Tech second and you have some great examples and I agree to some extent that's true but is a little bit

of you disappointed that it's less about the tech and building like new Financial products new Innovative apps for people

to use new ways to build blockchains new ways to build money like is there not a part of you that's a little disappointed

that you're now presenting a thesis that's sort of counter to that that you're presenting a thesis that it's

actually about these social meme coins um and like currencies for communities so this actually takes me back to

jordy's point which uh you have to isolate the product side of crypto or

the technology side of crypto and the actual token asset side of crypto and my

argument is that they're effectively two separate Industries right there's there are two separate things right no one is

stopping a distrib a passionate distributed systems engineer to go and build a bridge or to go and build some

kind of a platform that doesn't have a token right no one if you're passionate about if you're passionate about web 3

you can go and build the next forecaster without a token you know what I mean or the next Unis swap without a token no

one is denying that uh if you're super passionate about engineering you you can go do that however the issue this is my

core argument and this is probably one of the most important slides in my presentation right ready mem coins are

not a vampire attack against crypto Tech mem coins are a vampire attack against

Crypt Tech tokens that's a big difference here you understand

so I love technology and I'm all for decentralization I've been supporting

thousands of different things in crypto since 2014 but um we need to separate

the tokens we're trying to get so here is the biggest thing that you need to understand a lot of people that are

kneee in altcoins or altcoin sfts that are yet to launch they tweet things like

the rise of memec coins is a sign is the end of times it means that the industry is going is becoming degenerate it means

that the industry is being taken over by Zoomers with brain rot but the reality is the opposite this is what you need to

understand the rise of meme coins is a sign that that the industry is maturing

because we're finally accepting these coins for what they are the tech coins

the VCB coins they're actually the fake ones they're actually massively

overvalued don't just their valuations don't justify the revenue and the 95% of

their valuations are mimetic anyway so we are we're we're essentially the emperor has no close we're taking it to

the next logical stage which is you're going to have three asset classes you're going to have B C which is a store of

value and the future of gold you're going to have uh stable coins you're going to have temporarily 30 years from

now they're not going to exist uh third thing you're going to have with improved regulations you're going to have coins

that produce revenues that produce cash flows and they're going to be valued appropriately just like modern day

equities are by investment bankers and the fourth thing and that's the new emerging category is these tokenized

minia religions now you and I can debate whether they're overvalued or undervalued but they are coming they are

already emerging and some of them are going to be multicycle just like doas so um you know it it is a new paradigm it's

definitely a byproduct of the central banking system but it's here to stay I

think you you speak incredibly well about these things and that's why you know your your talk got more views and

vitalic you know like this is the stuff that people want to hear and and think about and

discuss let's let's let's dive into a couple of these things so the ne religion thing I actually agree with you

I've been thinking about this and I have some interesting uh follow on on on the religion thing I love like this point

but in the religion let's just like imagine this does get to that level what

is the role of the token in this religion like we're talking about like you so many people and like they they're

sharing the memes and like all this the token is is how people kind of you know

it's like their shelling point and and how they kind of got rich you know incentivized them together once things

settle down what is the role of the token um is

it like a representation of how well our country is doing you know are we expanding are we not expanding do we

need to do something like have you thought about that that that point um the closest metaphor and the closest

parallel that I found I think it's a church donation basket which is a two which is two-way right uh so it's a

two-way church donation basket that's I think that's the closest way to reason about it right now because I agree with

you they're not Equity they're not debt they're a little bit different to Tech alss as well they're not currencies some

people some people model them as social currencies I don't think so um I think what it is at the risk of sounding spicy

um they are vessels that are collecting some kind of a dissatisfaction or overall General emotion in the world and

by investing in them you're essentially trying to make some kind of a financial statement and that's why I'm very

bullish on them because I don't think we fully played out the story yet and the story is yet to play out and essentially

this is what I mean by when I say that they're essentially vessels of faith and vessels of dissatisfaction when you

essentially voting with your money and because a lot of people are like dissatisfied with democracy or whatever right now and different forms of

governance um this is essentially a lot of these things um they are a way to

make a statement in a capitalist cocoon and by investing in that you essentially want that idea to be pushed further in

the world does that make sense it makes sense but like I love the idea of like

you know this is going to create the momentum and we're going to get to certain market cap I'm just trying to go

past that and look at the game theory of like what's the equilibrium like is this a stable is this a stable like kind of like a an ash equilibrium where we stay

there or is this going to be like the Jimmy blip where you know there's a candle and then like we're kind of all the way back down and we saw like you

said with Elon he did try to get to that next level we're talking about Dogecoin

as being a currency and it's going to be accepted for goods and then he's trying to make it a money which you you kind of

like me I think we're both of us not quite convinced about trying to make

things uh pay for cars and [ __ ] like this like you know um it's it's a common

way that people try to elevate the the meme coin but it's it's it's kind of like unclear if that if that can work

maybe somebody will do it um so like that's not really clear and then in terms of ibrium there has to be more to

it right like I mean you you talked about how you're not that bullish on the animals and I think the reason why

you're not so bullish on the animals because when once you get to the further Point yeah it's cute you know blah blah

blah people buy pop pop pop pop but then there's not enough deeper meaning to make it a religious thing that's stable

is that right yeah exactly and one of my theories is that we are going to see a

gradual transition from animals to non-animals uh and the reason for that is because a lot of the non-animal stuff

for example like Giga and SPX are my top two biggest positions to me personally

as well as what I'm seeing in their respective communities they inspire people and they motivate people much

more than just funny animal pictures the funny animal pictures they are an echo of Doge and ship from last cycle right

this is a more of a 50 to 100 IQ play where people are like okay like dogs

worked last time let's create dogs again or let's create cats but the ones I'm promoting they're trying to be something

like next stage like the the future right and you always want to be you always want to be skating where the puck

is going so I I agree like at some point like these animals um just get repetitive and and it it's sort of like

not powerful enough I recently like this is this is you might find this interesting I haven't heard you talk about this so I want to get your

reaction um I was talking to a project recently and I actually think it's not

going to be any of the above it's going to be like an AI religion mem coin that's going to

actually blow up because all the stuff you're talking about people feeling under threat with like the world that

it's going and they're not getting their fair share uh they're also a lot of it is around like their threat of AI and

it's going to you know take away their job like whatever they're it's it's going to make them less important in the

world and and people are find they're trying to find ways to bet an AI I mean we're seeing like all these AI utility

coins get bit up so hard because people just want to have exposure to this thing that maybe is going to you know be the

future and this is crazy I talked to a project that's not launched yet they're kind of in uh beta so we're going to

hear about it probably in in the next couple months and what they've essentially done is tried to build a super AI that gives

people tasks and if they do the tasks it pays them money and so it's not a human you can't kill it it's just an AI they

want to build it in the middle of the ocean so it's international waters and like has this like you know non on uh

you know nobody can touch it and you you end up having a God Like an AI God that

is providing for his children with giving them tasks and then rewarding them and watching them he's in the discords he's in all the he's seeing

what people are saying and then deciding that to me sounds like uh stronger than even like uh you

know anti-wall street because it's more futuristic for sure uh that sounds very

interesting and I've also been reading about sort of AI driven daos and AI driven future corporations uh where the

cor most of the decision- making is made by an autonomous body at the top um I think those will definitely exist but I

think that's a conversation more appropriate for like six to eight years from now uh and our specific discussion

is about this current crypto cycle but you're already seeing like the AI stuff is uh you know having a lot of like

people want to people want AI coins AI coins are meme coins for midwit uh that's that's that's what's established

in my sort of community in among my friends um there are some of them have

had success precisely because they have launched early or allowed themselves to

be mined which mimicked the success of the 2013 2014 2015 coins and they've done that very very well because it's

the early price appreciation that leads to community building and that's why you

have t uh have such a powerful uh Community because a lot of uh pretty

much like lower middle class people became millionaires from it and now they can quit their jobs and become full-time

evangelists and promoters for this coin uh whether it's growth hacking marketing uh Media or even software engineering

itself right uh that's the way that's the way I view it that being said I still believe uh and that's a good

example right 99% of AI coins they are no different to alts and they are just m coins with more steps got it and

## Everything Going Up In 2025

speaking of this cycle your one of your predictions was that you know mecoin dominance to 10% uh so in order for that

to happen then there has to be Capital that comes from Bitcoin E salana A other

alts and you mentioned that you know mcoins are like a vampire Tech on Tech tokens uh but do you just expect maybe

next year when more retail piles in like the majority of their dollars are going to go into memes um do you expect

Bitcoin dominance to go down e dominance to go down salana dominance to go down and mcoin dominance to go up or do you

just expect most Alt altcoin Tech tokens to this trend to like minus 80% from

here and then all that speculative Beaver is going to just go into m coins um so I think everything is going to go

up in 2025 if we get a proper bll Market the question is what's going to go up more um and to answer your first

question I think the money into memes is going to go from a bunch of different places it's going to go from BTC eth and

soul it is going to go uh it's it's going to rotate from alts and it's going

to go directly from retail's bank accounts and the reason I say that is because there is a a large amount of

platforms being built right now and some that have already launched which essentially allow retail to buy meme

coins with one click uh just with their Apple pay which essentially allows them to skip or at least fully abstract all

of the gas stuff chain stuff eth stuff Soul stuff right so essentially effectively you're going from your like

debit card or from your bank account directly into the meme uh so yeah I think money is going to come into memes

from a bunch of different places it's not going to be just like any one place uh that being said I do think that we

are in the early stages of what I call Tech to meme rotation and it's still

it's still has several months to go and I want to ask one last question about a topic that I don't think I've heard you

speak too much about so I'd love to double click on there's this long tweet I won't bore you guys with about Provence coins or provenant coins I will

link it below but there's this whole class of tokens that are sort of in the meme coin sphere an example would be

like dog on base which is a fractionalized version of the Doge picture and then there's other coins

that are like I would put in The Accidental meme coin category so like a project founder deployed a token but

what before they deployed their very popular project we saw a couple versions of that last cycle what are your

thoughts on these accidental mem coins another one is the Constitution Dow token they were going to buy the Constitution that mem coin has performed

phenomenally well like do you think about those tokens at all um I think Providence coins are meme

coins too um it's it's the same thing um I think they will do well uh but

probably not as well as some of the others and the reason for that is because I anticipate or I speculate that

the vast majority of retail there's definitely some Providence enthusiasts out there but I think um the vast

majority of retail the mass majority of young people uh they will probably not like ascribe a mental premium to

Providence um another fun one uh since that we have someone who is thinking so much about meme coins we have two coins

that you don't talk about and know you don't want to like [ __ ] [ __ ] on anyone's coins because it's sort of like you know we don't fud anyone's bags but uh let's

take two of the most successful coins so we have bon and we have whiff and they're quite different in terms of um

you know even like one was a beir launch and one was a um air dropped launch one

is kind of more aligned with salana and maybe has like some bunk bot kind of

Revenue aspect the other one is just pure meme coin but they've both kind of

ended up in this similar price range right like couple billion type type of

price range um let's just get a prediction you know one year from now do

you think one of them performs and while it which which aspect do you think um

because they they're quite similar in a lot of ways I think whff will outperform

significantly uh precisely because it doesn't have a utility um which sounds crazy but let me

explain uh Bon has gradually been adding like a bunch of like D5 features trading

features revenue streams and I actually think that in like late capitalist uh sort of inflationary economy uh revenu

is arguably bullish because then you essentially like tether your potential valuation to some kind of a metric to

some kind of a uh like Revenue success numbers right but with utility it becomes purely about Spirit purely about

emotion purely about faith and I think if you study past cycles and by the way not just in crypto past Cycles but just

past financial markets past Tech Cycles um the things that go parabolic or the things that go craziest or the things

that like bubble up the most they are the things that are difficult to Value so uh like inability like all of this

like uh ambivalence and all of this like debates that we're having I think they're bullish because they don't

tether anything um they don't tether a mean coin that doesn't have utility to a

particular sort of like a cash flow point right and that's why I'm more bullish on things that don't have

utility than things that do so is it not worth it like for people building a project let's say you're building a

project it could have a coin uh would you not want to find a way for your Project's coin to get some of that power

some of that mimetic power and like add some of that mean coin element to it to bring that instead of just have it be

like a p that's well that's what all the altcoins that have ever existed been doing already you know what I mean um

essentially uh like I this is what I said earlier uh 85 to 90% of their like

valuation and of their of their market cap it was driven from that uh mimetic Power and so here's my thesis for this

cycle right uh because mean coins have better memes than uh the like the

mimetic element of altcoins meme coins are essentially stealing the mimetic

Premia they're stealing the speculative Premia from the altcoin complex right so before mean coins were like super famous

let's say 2022 2023 right let's say 2022 right before mean coins were super

famous like they are like they're starting to be right now um all of the global retail crypto Traders or crypto

investors they used altcoins as the sort of like gambling chips uh trading

Vehicles like volatility uh like Vehicles whatever right but now meme

coins do that so much better because um a like they move faster they move more

volatile and because of that they're stealing that excitement and they're stealing that both speculative and mimic

premum away from alts this is why like the existence of meme coins they're essentially like a vampire attack on the

mimetic Premia that existed in alts and that's how I would answer your question this is a little fun question so you

know I'm commonly known as the mid curve on this podcast and CT um and I often

buy tokens with fundamentals um and I do okay right but I'm obviously not as

wealthy as you uh so I know that you know a lot of people feel this way right we want to buy Tech coins and whatnot uh

what lessons or what advice would you have for me uh to stop being a mid curve and just embrace the left curve nature

or maybe the right curve nature of your thesis um I don't think you're a mid curve I've actually been listening to a

lot of your videos for a very long time now I think the reality is that you've built a brand uh you've built a brand

that is uh around like defi protocols and that is around sort of like yield

farming token omics like smart contract interactions Etc so it would simply be weird for you to just like suddenly

pivot to mean coins right now which is totally understandable and by the way um the way I see it is I actually think dii

usage and dii volumes are going to be continue are going to continue to

increase indefinitely the question we're debating though are the tokens and like Jordy said like I said the actual defi

software and the tokens that are Loosely attached to them you know what I mean we need to uh analyze them from two

different lights right and the situation is that unfortunately both good and bad

D5 projects are currently collectively thrown into the same bucket as a lot of infrastructure utility Tech alts VC back

alts sex launches right now and that's why they're not doing as well right but the question I mean uh arguably they've

always been overvalued if we're just using the fee Generation stuff right I'm sure you would agree uh that being said

I think eventually like in the next two or three Cycles they're going to be trading like similar to equity based on

like revenues fee generation maybe with some Premia because they have Global access or whatever right but ultimately

um essentially that overvaluation that they always had for the past two cycles mcoins are stealing that right now and

## Sports Betting vs Memecoins

that's why we're having a mcoin cycle mad uh I'm sure everyone who's been listening is kind of been paying

attention because I my my brain is so stimulated there's so many things to think about

you have presented uh just like fantastic uh corridors to go down and investigate

and think through I'm not 100% sure if indeed the percentage of the market that is the uh crypto total Market um and the

ratio of meme coins will end up being so high I I'm sure it will have a significant part um I want to like leave

listeners with one analogy that I've been thinking about that maybe you can appreciate but um like you said most of these

tokens uh were just giving people the chance to gamble and I remember like 2016 when I was on coinbase and it was

like xrp and ethereum and Litecoin and Bitcoin four coins that was it and it

was just obvious to me that people would buy the cheap one because like it just seems cheaper so you buy the cheap one

and that's literally all that went into it like xrp went to you know billions and billions based on like this simple

idea because people just wanted to bet that's all the options they had and as the years go on we have more and more options and now there's a purity of just

like this is just the gamble part that's kind of what the real product Market fit is it's all speculation like you were

saying on one of the previous podcasts most of the successful apps or all of them have been around the speculation

aspect and and you people wanting to bet one interesting analogy though is the um

the sports betting market and the ability of that to create an economy and

the ability of sports teams and athletes to monetize there's two types of sports

betting there's the um real sports betting where you're watching the game you're watching

the football player the basketball player and you're betting and people are going crazy right now especially in the US like regulations relaxed I don't know

if you looked at the numbers but like it's just incredible the amount of betting that is going on and that

obviously increases the salaries of the players the value of the teams that

these billionair are buying because it just filters down you know you got the TV rights you got the ad Revenue rights

from all these gambling companies and it just filters down in my opinion there's a chance that you might be wrong

because those things have a realness to it like there's a real coin there's an

igen layer there's something behind it and people are betting but like there's an actual athlete compare it to like

online casinos where you have like fake horse races where it's just like a crash game or something where there's no we

can't pretend that it's real because we know it's not like we can't even pretend like basically like the thesis is and

some people believe that you might be wrong because the lack of being able to pretend that there is actually like a

tech or there's a there there um will Al alienate most of the retail like most

retail do want to at least pretend like there's a real game and there's a real football player rather than just betting on a screen um you know there's like

five cartoon horses and you have to bet on which one's going to win and there's a market for that like some people just

like want to bet on that yeah so uh in your in I don't think there's a contradiction at all because in this

case the athletes are the community members does that make sense the fundamentals are the people right the

fundamentals are the people even more so than the memes themselves I actually had that in my I had I had a slide about

this exact exact same question that you're posing right now in my in my presentation I said the word meme coin

is a misnomer it's a misnomer because the memes are only 30 40% of it you know

uh 50 60% of it is actually the people uh and you're essentially buying into a

social club you're buying into a digital Network State you're buying into like a Neo Dao right um and whether whether

it's an artistic component or whether it's some kind of like a collective lore Universe component it's there right uh

some people kind of get it quicker some people get it slower but in this case the athletes are the community members

it's probably the loudest community members practically speaking but everybody is playing a role here the other thing I'll say is you said like

there is no realness to it but I think just because this realness is digital

and it exists on social media it exists on Twitter it exists on Discord telegram

Tik Tok doesn't mean that it's not real it doesn't need to be tangible uh and mean coins what they do is they tokenize

all things intangible yeah I mean I'm very open to to your idea I'm I'm open

to both realities of the world one where the stronger fighting is between like the ethereum versus salana that also

seems to get people very religious and very riled up and a lot of people bet on each one um versus you know just like

cat dog or whatever where they can't pretend like there's a you know a real technology behind it so uh it'll be

fascinating to see how it plays out and and I'm I'm very open to to all worlds um maybe let's move to uh pasta of the

## Pasta of the Week

week Justin you wna you want to kick off some pastas yeah I'll kick us off um so

Jordan Peterson here tweets the purpose of life is finding the largest you can largest burden you can bear and Barett

and uh you know Jordan Peterson Great Book 12 rules for life very applicable I think I took some of his lessons a

little too seriously uh Sherlock huddles quote tweeted this with a chart of e BTC

and um yeah I think there's definitely some meaning there and bearing the larest burden um you can bear just

sticking with it but I also want to ask you marad because we never really touched on this and I know this isn't really your focus but like what are your

thoughts just generally on eth BTC and the state of ethereum right now this is not my area of expertise but my gut feel

is that salana will do slightly better in 2025 the reason I say that is because

you need to go back to the origins and study how both e eth token and soul

token uh got their valuations like and the reason for the way I view e and soul

they're essentially casinos when C where certain micro it's like an ecosystem of ecosystems and where certain things

happen and the reason why e token got monetized in the first place is because

you needed to buy the E token in order to invest into the icos so effectively

if you view ethereum as a country a borderless country it the E token becomes the currency in order

essentially becomes their unit of account and medium of exchange and also uh with all of the leftover money in

people's metamask wallets it effectively becomes store of value as well and when you add all of those store of values it essentially gets this monetization the

uh then that story continued with defi uh yield farming and ponies with uh 2020

2021 but it's the same thing you need eth in order to participate with nfts in

order to participate in Def farming Etc right uh I think have similar thing similar same exact thing is happening with soul right now but with like meme

coins and whether you like hyper gambling side of meme coins or you like the more cult building side of meme

coins you still need need soul in order to participate and that creates a natural demand for soul as the unit of

account medium of exchange and to some extent store of value in the country that is salana right now I expect both

the hyper gambling side of meme coins and the cult building side of me coins to continue in 2025 uh the Frank reality is that

there's just simply going to be much more gambling on salana than there is going to be on ethereum in 2025 from

what we are seeing right now that's why salana will probably outperform e that being said I think they will both go up

but I think Solana will go up a little bit more thank you I appreciate it heyy you want to go yeah so you know I do

this Meetup event in New York once a month and two months ago I did one and like two people showed up and I was

really sad this time around um I spent like an hour planning this and like 30

people came um and it was a blast and I was like oh my God like this is amazing people came this time people care about

me but then if you scroll down I think the reality is that you know Jordy and Justin actually paid everyone to show up

so I didn't feel like a pure loser so I was like oh this is so true so thank you Jordy and Justin I felt really good for

like 24 hours but you know they are all paid anytime anytime everyone's a paid

show I love it um marad did you have a a pasta um I haven't been spending that

much time on Twitter over the past sort of uh 12 to 24 hours so a particular pasta doesn't really uh come come to

mind right now what do your notifications look like right now I mean so I actually used to read almost all of

my uh replies and like from April until

like August uh I used to read literally every single reply because I know um

it's very tedious but there was a lot of alpha there and the alpha came from uh

frequency of rating uh amount of rating different unique uh sort of like high

follower accounts rating and also the tastefulness and the artfulness of the memes both picture memes and video memes

themselves right so I could kind of G because I was already kind of slowly growing uh pre parabolic but like slowly

growing as uh just like a Twitter person um I could kind of sense the approximate

relative power of different mem coin communities but also the approximate

sort of IQ of their Raiders right let's put it that way and um that gave me a decent gut feel about the how

interesting and how ambitious and how passionate and how much time these guys spend on these meme coins so it used to

be a lot of alpha now that now that I've gotten another 30,000 followers it's be

like the risk reward of spending time on this is becoming a little bit worse uh nevertheless um I I spend a lot of time

on Twitter just because like that's that's kind of like the Town Hall that's the Amsterdam Town Square of crypto so

you kind of have to do that how are your dopamine receptors doing Mar you must have so much dopamine like every day you

wake up it's like everyone's calling you like you know mean Point Jesus you must feel like a god right you look like

Jesus too I I it's just the hair is purely coincidental and it just literally came from me uh I actually

shaved my hair two years ago exactly and then I just like didn't go to a barber at all for two years and now it looks

like this uh but I honestly like I know it's like all jokes and stuff but I want to encourage people to like not call me

Jesus not call me a messiah uh not me some kind of a cult leader really what

I'm trying to do is just to identify uh what I personally subjectively think are

undervalued like meme coin communities and mem coin tokens and just kind of like spread the word about that right uh

but I I'm not trying to be any kind of religious leader or anything like that how about the uh roaring Kitty analogy

like you know you just like the coin is that is that okay yeah I can certainly see the similarities between between

that but again like I'm not trying to be any of movement leader what I am first and foremost is an investor uh and I'm

simply uh sort of and this is what I meant when I said that the roles of a participant and the investor are being

hybridized into one and everybody essentially at least in the mean coin game honestly in the altcoin game as well let's be real but in all of this

crypto altcoin complex um everybody is both a participant and an investor at the same time uh very cool uh I'll have

my little pasta It's a quick one but I I saw this and I just chuckled um you know there's so much controversy he you

opened the Twitter it's all war fighting and Zack xpt is going after everybody

and new says hey what's Adam Cochran's take on Zach versus mad whatever it is

mine is the exact opposite amongst all the craziness and you know the people arguing I think uh

we all we can all agree that maybe the opposite of Adam Cochran is the right take so wait for so my take on all of

this is the following right both in life in general long term but also

um like intracycle where we are right now uh we are switching from what people kind of semi jokingly refer to as like

PVP year three to a PVE year 4 and um

both in terms of your overall Twitter interactions uh but also in terms of

your like meme coin picks and Community picks I think um actually like love

kindness and wholesomeness um it will take you further than just like trying to be like trying to pick fights or

trying to be toxic or trying to be like PvP with others um and yeah I think that

kind of philosophy is actually like 1 plus one equals three type situation and I'm just always looking for those like

win-win-win type situations rather than fighting for like a small piece of the pie with others yeah and I I love the

win-win stuff as well uh let's end it on uh a question so um you know in the in

I've heard you say that basically like everything is just on uh salana and ethereum for the most part because

that's where like most of the money is and uh you know the puff Community has been trying to expand its wings and and

you know fly out of just the manful money and and kind of into the rest do you think that uh I mean it's easy to do

it nowadays because you do a layer zero rapper or one of these rappers and and you kind of fly off to another land do

you think that salana Community would accept an an ebased token or vice versa

like what are you seeing because you're seeing uh some of the tokens go both ways or do you think it's better to just focus on on ethereum for uh for a token

that's kind of B birth there yeah so uh just to give you an

example what SPX 6900 has done very well is that they are on ethereum they are on

salana and they are on base and we're potentially even I believe the community is discussing uh maybe even bridging to

sui uh eventually right so my view is that it's you want you kind of want to

mentally treat the different chains as centralized exchanges in and of themselves because they're essentially

um distribution platforms right they are and because of that you definitely have

advantages from uh being multi-chain I mean there are coins that have literally like kind of bridged themselves to like all of the 30 chains or whatever but I

think that's too much you just but I think there is an inherent advantage in being like on all of the top three four five chain well noted R we want to thank

you I'm sure this is uh going to be one of the most fascinating episodes we've had for listeners hope everybody enjoys

it vote for pasta of the week and uh yeah hope hopefully we'll have you on again rad thank you for coming I

appreciate it thank you thank you thank you everybody
