## What is a Coordination Failure?

Here are some examples of coordination failures in the modern world:

- **Nation-states** refuse to give up nuclear weapons because they want to defend themselves despite the existential threat they pose to the world.
    
- **Consumers** refuse to abandon fossil fuel-powered services because they want to move easily despite the existential threat that burning fossil fuels poses to the world.
    
- **Open Source software users** consume Open Source software because they want to build things faster, despite the burnout that cumulative use imposes on OSS maintainers.
    
- **Individual cells in the human body** live harmoniously by pooling their resources for the greater good of the organism; however, if one cell disrupts this balance, it becomes cancerous, eventually supplanting all other cells and taking over the body.
    
- **Coordination failure can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.** For example, if a company decides that a recession is imminent and lays off its workers, other companies might lose demand due to the layoffs and react by laying off their own workers, leading to a recession.
    

**Coordination failures are dystopias without a dictator**, situations that every citizen, including leaders, despises but that persist nonetheless without being overcome. **From a divine perspective**, there is a clear problem with coordination failures; **from within the system**, no actor can create change, so the best option is often to continue ignoring the problem.

### Multipolar Traps

Coordination failures have also been called multipolar traps. A multipolar trap looks like this:

1. Humans want to breathe clean air.
    
2. There is work to be done to prevent pollution from having a high ppm (parts per million) in the air we breathe.
    
3. Since clean air is **non-rival** (my consumption does not prevent you from consuming it) and **non-exclusive** (you cannot put clean air behind a velvet rope and charge for it), this means that each individual actor has a rational incentive to free ride on the system. Why contribute to a fund to maintain clean air if I can already get it for free? **This is the first trap: the solo trap.**
    
4. If enough actors choose to free ride, the entire system begins to bear a burden, and if that burden increases to the point of systemic collapse, no one will obtain those public goods. **This is the second trap: the multiplayer trap.**
    
5. From a divine perspective, the obvious solution is for everyone to contribute a little, but without a coordination mechanism to ensure that everyone contributes, they do not.
    

One way to reduce the impact of coordination failures is to sufficiently improve coordination so that individual players in the game play it as a multiplayer game.

When players in the game perceive a common identity or goal with one another, or if they have the negative externalities of their behavior taken into account in the market-based decisions they make, they play the game together rather than separately—and avoid the second trap.
