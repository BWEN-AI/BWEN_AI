There are different concepts for voting based on the tokens involved:

- Some protocols consider that one token equals one vote, allowing holders to vote on any proposal simply by holding those tokens in a wallet.

- Other protocols, like Curve, stipulate that voting is only possible when the tokens are locked, demonstrating the user's time and financial investment within the protocol. With Curve, locking tokens (for a period ranging from 7 days to 4 years) in the form of veCRV grants voting rights, while simple CRV holders do not have this right. This approach allows only those who are invested in the protocol to vote on various features.

It's also important to note that the understanding of governance proposals is sometimes weak, which can explain the low participation rates in governance votes. Understanding a proposal requires a solid grasp of the DeFi ecosystem, all possible actions by the protocol, and synergies with other protocols. For instance, to vote on a proposal suggesting a synergy between protocol A and protocol B, it is essential to thoroughly understand the activities of both protocols to comprehend the potential synergies. This understanding can discourage holders who are only in it for speculative purposes and may not be particularly interested in the protocol's governance, even though this governance will impact token prices and directly influence the token's appreciation over time.

In addition to this overall understanding of the ecosystem, it is necessary to grasp the proposals themselves, including how the protocol will be improved by each proposalâ€”both in terms of the proposal's content and its added value, as well as the coding aspect to ensure that the proposal is well-developed and free of security vulnerabilities once implemented. Typically, Genesis teams guide these proposals and facilitate their implementation, both in formulating the proposals and in creating the code itself, ensuring its integration into the rest of the protocol's code. They also consider the synergies that the proposals might generate, especially if there are interactions that lead multiple protocols to work together.
